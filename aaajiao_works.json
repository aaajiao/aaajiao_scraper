Goooooooooogle infiltration, consisting of ten screens placed across the almost 14-meter long wall facing out towards Ernst-Reuter-Platz, explores, utilizes and critiques Google’s AVA program. aaajiao takes the freely available, already processed datasets from AVA and manipulates the image. While maintaining the visual language of AVA, with its use of the purple bounding boxes, he eliminates the desired information. An overload of images is flashing increasingly more rapid before the viewer. Mundane movements take on an air of suspicion hidden from view. The work A.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration is installed on the ground floor of the former IBM building on Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here, in the 1960s, the first data processors were installed, clearly on view to all passersby in West-Berlin. Now we are the data, we provide the data, we analyze the data and are continuously more influenced by our own data. Logged in, cookies saved, and continuously tracked, our lives are lived more and more online. The potential influence our own data may have over us is looming before us.",

This serves as a visual interpretation of the \"Internet void.\" The installation \"Agent,\" composed of two flexible screens, discusses the relationship between hallucinations created by AI algorithms in graphic generation and human imagination.",

    "description_en": "aaajiao’s latest videos, photographs, and installations inspired by Hideki Takayasu’s 1986 book “Furakutaru” (Fractals in Physical Science [Nonlinear science: theory & application]). Over the past years, aaajiao has been researching for a series of comparative studies between the theory of fractals and Chinese philosophy (and medical science). His algorithmic methodology enables him to scan human body and track a new set of meridian systems. Combining these algorithms with art of tattoo, he transplants this internal micro-universe into the gallery space. This attempt to represent the energy sources, by outlining these ever-changing and active channels, also portrays unanticipated aspects of the personality of individuals.",
    "description_cn": "aaajiao乃以高安秀树关于分形理论的经典著作《分数维》（1986）为出发点，他将现代分形理论、计算机算法贯穿至他对中医的经络研究中。Aaajiao的这组现场作品集合了装置、摄影、录像等媒介，通过对人体的扫描，算法的解读，将人体内无形的能量场域外化进展览现场，并转译成为文身图案。",

    "description_en": "Again using computer algorithms to recreate natural processes, aaajiao created a series of clouds floating on LCD screens. The portability of the medium (liquid crystal display being the new scroll painting, as it were) is negated by either fastening the screens to suspended girders, or placing them on concrete plinths. These pieces simultaneously engage the massive construction projects going on across China (and with that, the wanton destruction of traditional neighborhoods) and the peaceful contemplation seen in traditional Chinese painting and writing. They also represent the exciting modes of cultural transmission in the contemporary world. At once, these pieces evoke Alfred Stieglitz’s Equivalents and sculptural Minimalism. Liam Gillick, in describing the work of Donald Judd, puts it nicely. “You are not supposed to fixate on the structures in isolation or to over rationalise them within the late modernist tendency towards reduction. The work functions best when it is allowed to hover between its connection to its given location and the rest of the relative experience we bring to the room.”",

    "description_en": "In his latest piece Cloud, 12 flat and cold screens simulate a small region of a dark sky, but in the other way this matrix is able to contain a boundless 3-dimension sky of a digital reality. Clouds generated by the artist’s computing language are seen flying over the screens… So how do we feel the textile dimension, the color, or even temperature…of a virtual object? Apparently, we very much rely on the knowledge understanding of the technology application, but maybe in the not far future, a sixth sense will finally be stimulated in human body to deal with the cyber reality.",

    "description_en": "Anxieties over identity have prompted us to find a new role: the user. With this identity as background, we used a graphics processing software to draw a column; each time we finished a section we would modify the computer system time — it could head towards the future, and so it could trace back in history. But the computer’s sense of time that seems infinite has to do with a limitation we programmed based on an overall evaluation (1969- 2038, OS X), and this state of conflict between the finite and the infinite is precisely the psychological reality we experience the moment the body and media melt together.",
    "description_cn": "身份的焦虑促使我们找到了新的角色 — 用户，以此身份为背景，利用图形学编程软件在桌面上绘制一座柱，每绘制一块就修改一次电脑系统时间，既可以前往未来，也可以回溯历史。虽然计算机的系统时间看似无限，但实际上却被开发者出于整体考虑做了限制 (OS X，1969–2038)，一种无限又有限的矛盾状态正是我们处于身体和媒体交融瞬间的现实心境。",

    "description_en": "\"Fine-tuning\" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named \"Internet void\" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction. This serves as a visual interpretation of the \"Internet void.\"\n\n\"Fine-tuning\" deconstructs the definition of fine-tuning in the application of LLM by documenting the manual adjustment of the character's facial and body parameters (craftsmanship) during the character creation process.",

    "description_en": "\"Guard\" is a installation artwork created using silicone, 3D printing, and fiberglass, depicting the figure of a security guard bearing the artist's own face. The inspiration for this piece comes from the unique role and circumstances of security guards in Chinese society during the COVID-19 lockdowns. During this period, security guards—typically individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, veterans, or increasingly unemployed college graduates—were suddenly granted temporary authority by local governments. Empowered overnight, these guards rapidly transformed from community caretakers into authoritarian enforcers, imposing harsh and sometimes brutal measures upon the very residents they once served, resulting in numerous tragedies.\n\nThe artist compares this months-long, severe lockdown to a \"Stanford Prison Experiment\" involving billions of people, using the artwork to explore the moral dilemmas and struggles of individuals under extreme authoritarian conditions. By placing his own face onto the security guard figure, the artist reflects upon his own potential complicity: if placed in an increasingly extreme environment, would he also be forced to don the guard's uniform, feign sleep, avoid confronting reality, or even become an executor of oppressive power?\n\nThrough \"Guard,\" the artist seeks to provoke contemplation on the human predicament under authoritarian rule, while also critically examining his own position as someone who has left Shanghai, now lives in Berlin, and holds the privilege of narrating the pains and traumas of this era.",

Dressed in a standard security uniform, the figure sits in a chair, as if drifting into a nap.\n\nIn China, security work was once largely taken by veterans and older rural migrants. Since the pandemic, it has also become a fallback for unemployed youth—jokingly grouped online with cleaners and nannies as the “Auspicious Three Treasures.” A meme on the Simplified-Chinese internet quips: “Young people becoming security guards, skipping forty years of detours.” During lockdowns, guards—under verbal administrative mandate—managed gates and order within residential compounds, becoming, at the scale of the neighborhood, “the smallest unit of fascism,” and a locus of trauma for many who were sealed in. Yet the work is often monotonous and solitary. Many young guards turned to personal channels and vlogs, hoping the attention economy might lift low wages and grant visibility.",

    "description_en": "On 06.01.2018, the 1000+ Experimental Project Space of A Thousand Plateaus Art Space will launch the first new-year plan with a solo project - “Gluttony” from the artist Aaajiao. Instead of pursuing the maturity and integrity, this Experimental Project Space focuses on the experimental composition of emerging artists with a more open attitude to explore the possibility of the creation and presentation and to strive for a unique exhibition experience. Aaajiao, is the pseudonym of the young artist Xu Wenkai and the avatar of his virtual network. He was born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities, Xi’an, but now lives and works in Shanghai and Berlin. The composition of Aajiao contains a strong dystopian awareness and a profound reflection on literati spirits and sophistications. Many of his works are devoted to the exploration of cultural and social phenomena around the influence of new technology and media. These works, ranging from the social media writing and the data processing to the new aesthetic landscape through the Internet and mobile media, bring the special Chinese social media culture and technology the international art discussions. The composition of Aaajiao also crosses different medias with its abundant number and forms. In 2017, he composed the video work of \"archives, Candy Wrappers\", “Progress Bar”, \"Column\", \"Candy Wrappers\", and \"Lorem Ipsum\"; the installation of \"404 Installation\", \" Water Measure - Petroleum\", and \"Membranization\"; the sound installation of \"Collective Behavior\"; as well as the Gif animation work of \"Avatar” and more. Based on the online network and its visual and cultural phenomenon, these works are all attempt to explore the sociology and the visual and image morphology. In the beginning of 2018, \"Gluttony \" as a new 1000+ experimental project will continue this clue in thousand plateau art space, and explore “how self as an observer gets along with the self devouring the pain through the gluttony?”. This new solo project, belongs to the \"Membranization” series -- from the use of machines, to the collusion of machines, and even to be held hostage by the machines, there are subtle changes of human emotions in terms of facing the machines. It is unable to use these rotten fermentations of social media to record those changes, however, the combination of some materials clearly depicts the emotional contours, and the light properties of the material itself also implies the disguised emotions. Aaajiao’s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world, upcoming and recent shows include “Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today”, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, Boston (2018); “unREAL”, Haus der elektronischen Künste, Basel (2017); “Shanghai Project Part II”, Shanghai (2017); “Temporal Turn: Art and Speculation in Contemporary Asia”, Spencer Museum of Art, Kansas (2016); “Take Me (I’m Yours)” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jens Hoffmann and Kelly Taxter), Jewish Museum, New York (2016); “Overpop”, Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2016); “Hack Space” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Amira Gad), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space, Hong Kong and chi K11 art museum, Shanghai (2016); “Globale: Global Control and Censorship”, ZKM | Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (2015); “Thingworld International Triennial of New Media Art”, The National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2014); and Transmediale, Berlin (2010). His solo exhibition includes: “Remnants of an Electronic Past”, Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art, Manchester (2016); OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal Xi’an, Xi’an (2016), among others.",
    "description_cn": "2018年1月6日，千高原艺术空间的1000+实验项目空间将启动新年的第一个计划，带来艺术家aaajiao的个人项目“暴食／Gluttony”。千高原的实验项目空间以新锐艺术家的实验性创作为主，不追求作品与主题的成熟度或完整性，而是以更加开放的姿态，探索创作与展示的可能性，并努力带来特殊的观展体验。aaajiao，是年轻艺术家徐文恺的化名，也是他虚构的网络分身。他于1984年出生于中国最古老城市之一的西安，现生活和工作在上海与柏林两地。aaajiao的创作结合了浓重的反乌托邦意识，以及对文人精神的反思。他的很多作品都致力于探索新的科技和媒体影响之下的文化与社会现象。作品涵盖了社交媒体写作，数据处理，以及网络和移动媒介下的新美学景观，将今天中国特殊的社交媒体文化和科技带入了国际艺术的讨论当中。aaajiao的创作跨越不同的媒介，且数量和形态都非常丰富。在2017年，他的作品主要有影像作品“档案糖纸”，“进度条”，“柱”，“糖纸”，“乱数假文”；装置作品“404”，“水侧.石油”，“膜化”；声音装置“集群行为”；Gif动画作品“头像”等十余件，都围绕着以网络及其视觉和文化现象为基础的，对社会学话题，或者视觉与图像形态的探索。而在2018年的伊始，“Gluttony / 暴食”作为新的1000+实验项目将在千高原艺术空间继续这一线索，探究“作为自我的观察者将如何与吞噬痛苦的暴食自我相处？”，此项目从属于 “Membranization / 膜化系列”——从使用机器，到与机器共谋，甚至被机器所挟持，人类的情绪在面对机器时发生着微妙的变化，记录这些变化已经无法使用那些腐烂发酵的社交媒体，一些材料的组合却能够清晰刻画些许情绪的轮廓，材料本身的轻质属性同样暗示着情绪的隐蔽性。aaajiao的创作作品频繁展出于全球的美术馆和艺术机构，例如：《1989年到今天：网络时代的艺术》，美国波士顿当代艺术中心 ICA Boston，2018；《非真实》，瑞士巴塞尔电子艺术之家（HeK），2017；《身体·媒体II》，上海当代艺术博物馆，2017；《上海种子》，2017；《带我走（我是你的）》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Jens Hoffmann策展），美国纽约犹太人美术馆，2016；《时间转向：当代亚洲的艺术与思辨》，美国堪萨斯斯班塞美术馆，2016；《波普之上》，上海余德耀美术馆，2016；《黑客空间》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Amira Gad策展），香港K11艺术基金会临时空间及上海chi K11美术馆，2016；《全方位：全控制和言论控制》，德国ZKM卡尔斯鲁厄艺术与媒体中心，2015；《齐物等观——2014国际新媒体艺术三年展》，北京中国国家美术馆，2014，等。",

    "description_en": "- This set resembles the 404 collective performance by aaajiao in collaboration with Sankuanz and GATE that will happen on 20.09 at our store.\n\n- It is composed of a blank white t shirt, a HTTP404 roller and two ink bootles that will allow you to create a HTTP404 garment by yourself. Only 30 sets were handmade worldwide and each one is numbered.\n\nWash Care: Machine Wash at or below 30°C, Do Not Bleach, Do Not Iron, Do Not Tumble Dry\n\n\"404 is the error message which appears on blocked websites in China. Translating the digital message back into analog form, 404 is aaajiao’s subtle commentary on censorship and the flow of information in our digital culture. The message is always the same, no matter the diversity of content it is covering from view. Entirely site-specific, this work takes a new form with each installation; multiplying the message 404 in a diversity of forms and contexts.\"\n\nCOLLABORATIVE PERFORMANCE - Visitors will be directly involved in 404 painting the fabric on the wall with a special roller.\n\nThe fabric will be then taken down and recycled into special t-shirts that will be part of something special and meaningful for a good cause. More info soon.\n\nDO IT YOURSELF - You will also be able to purchase a special DIY set during the event, composed of a small Roller, a blank tee and some ink in order to create your own 404.",

    "description_en": "I Hate People but I Love You, is a large format single channel video installation. Set in Mac OS, the video features two cyborgs, one of which is an anticipated Asian female android, the other in disguise of a floating Möbius strip composed of pop-up windows. Both immerse themselves in a reiterated deadpan conversation: “…May I be your friend? Do I look real to you? I hope so…” “I hate people but I love you.” The classic sci-fi paradigm of dystopian sentiments regarding social interaction and loneliness is not only proven in today's social media life, but also redefines the boundaries of interpersonal emotion between users and operations.",

If we look the screen as a new dimension and the blue color will be the identified symbol for this new space. It likes a door to the new world.\n\nThe MaxMara coat is classic and always be truly exist in our real world. Now in the screen, with the new descript logic, the MaxMara will also can be identified as a classic and fashion object. We think that this style will be timeless in both of the two dimensions of the world.\n\nAs MaxMara expressed the fashion as classic and significant imagine of the object, the blue in the screen also has the character of simple but classic and unique. We express the fashion style in the screen dimension through the MaxMara coat in blue.\n\nThe basic idea of my work is happen within this “blue” dimension. In this area, we use a new way to explain the original object. If we said that in our real word, the light is light and the shadow is shadow, both of these two things are separated and only can be described by themselves. But now in the new dimension, light can be described by the shadow which we can feel that the light and shadow are combine together in one concept, that is why we call it “light IS shadow”.",

    "description_en": "和aaajiao的第一次见面，还是上一个夏天。得到同艺术家合作的可能性，还是第一次。脑子里的第一个反应是：到底应该做一件像艺术品的衣服？还是一件像衣服的艺术品？想来想去，作品要有作品的风格，衣服应该有衣服的样子。那我们就做一件工作服该有的样子吧。-Ginger （Majorelle）综合比较了经典外衣的各种版型，我们决定从四口袋的Military M65夹克原型着手。通过一次又一次白胚布样，并让不同高矮胖瘦的男性女性朋友模特试穿、调整。出现了我们现在这款男女通吃的版型，只需要对应胸围尺寸，就可以放心穿着。",
    "description_cn": "印花部分，为了让印花和 _Limited Landscape Unlimited Wave_ 的算法效果吻合度更高，突出精髓，我们选择了工艺复杂的七块版分别裁片定位以及手工丝网印。透明部分，我们采用了有着良好弹性和耐磨性的TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethanes) 材质。TPU作为弹性体是介于橡胶和塑料之间的一种材料，这从它的刚性看出来，TPU的刚性可由弹性模量来度量。橡胶的弹性模量通常在1~10Mpa，TPU在10~1000Mpa，塑料（尼龙，ABS，PC，POM）在1000~10000Mpa。TPU 的硬度范围相当宽，从Shore A 60~Shore D 80并且在整个硬度范围内具有高弹性；TPU在很宽的温度范围内-40~120摄氏度，具有柔性，而不需要增塑剂； TPU对油类（矿物油，动植物油脂和润滑油）和许多溶剂有良好的抵抗能力；TPU 还有良好的耐天候性，极优的耐高能射线性能。众所周知的耐磨性，抗撕裂性，屈扰强度都是优良的；拉伸强度高，伸长率大，长期压缩永久变形率低等都是TPU的显著优点。",

    "description_en": "Built on iconic clips by Guo Laoshi and Yaoshui-ge, catchphrases like “yesmola,” “mi hotel,” and “Are you worthy?” become kinetic typography—breath and beat for the screen. Through repetition, language amplifies itself, conjuring a “livestream ritual” that keeps generating. Seeing and being seen iterate between barrages and clips; the crowd touches a fleeting bond in the carnival, only to meet, in the hush after laughter, the lezi-ren’s (fun-seeker’s) alienation and hollow core—loneliness returning like an echo from noise. “Abstract culture” names an online subculture that is anti-logic, anti-narrative, anti-authority, dissolving mainstream speech through profanity, dialect, semantic slippage, and insider jargon. Emerging from the livestream wave circa 2015 and streamer scenes like “6324,” it grows through watching, mockery, and remixes. Its pull is an instant gratification of “anti-common sense—anti-refinement—anti-logic,” feeding a watchword of entertainment-first; viewers gain a brief illusion of commonality by repetition and remix. Yet most look on as lezi-ren, consuming others’ embarrassment with spoof and cold sneer. The ties are thin, the affect low: synchronous bustle alongside deep solitude. Abstract culture offers a chorus-ready template, but struggles to form durable bonds, reflecting how “person-to-person” relations hollow out in an atomized society.",
    "description_cn": "以郭老师与药水哥的标志性片段为骨架，将“耶斯莫拉”“迷hotel”“您配吗”等梗语以动态字体化作屏幕的呼吸与鼓点，让语言在复读中自我增幅，召唤出一场持续生成的“直播仪式”。看与被看在弹幕与切片之间迭代，围观者在狂欢中获得短暂连结，却在笑声散场的静默里照见“乐子人”式的疏离与空心，孤独像回声一样从喧嚣深处返场。抽象文化可被概括为一种反逻辑、反叙事、反权威的网络亚文化，通过脏话、方言、错位语义与黑话化再生产，完成对主流话语的“消解”与“滑移”。其渊源可追溯至2015年前后的直播潮与“6324”等主播社群生态，并在围观、嘲讽、二创的循环中被持续放大。抽象内容以“反常识—反精致—反逻辑”的即时愉悦为吸力，满足“娱乐至上”的观看逻辑，观众通过复读与二创获得短暂的共同体错觉。然而，围观者多以“乐子人”心态消费“他者的出丑”，以恶搞与冷嘲构筑脆弱的连接，情感承诺极低，导致共时热闹与纵深孤独并存。抽象文化提供了可快速合唱的语言模板，却难以生成稳定的社群纽带，映照出社会原子化语境中“人—人关系”的空洞化。",

    "description_en": "aaajiao(Xu Wenkai) is a media artist and a media and internet activist, he created his new work by visualizing Chinese mainstream news portals wireframe from 1999 to 2016. This work is expressed as a digital landscape of banners that give physical form to the works abstract description. Ultimately this work expresses objection to the consumption of information occurring in todays ‘digital world’, a form of ‘cheap and useless’ consumption that does not create anything meaningful. aaajiao makes data structure into changing comparative digital forms or ‘banners’ to investigate whether people change through consuming and digesting information in this age where information data and daily life are binding ever more closely. The title of this work like a code name of an organization or operation, sounds like a code command, concealing its double intent. We welcome ’s first occupation of REFORMERart city public art space on Hunan Road.",

Utilizing the Toxxy Style LoRA model—specifically finetune to generate images of gender-transitioning individuals during mid-transformation states—the artist creates a paradoxical “Anime-style girl” avatar whose synthetic speech recursively recites the algorithmic prompts that birth her existence. The work positions AI generation as modern alchemy, where “cuteness” becomes a technological spell encoding complex sociopolitical negotiations about gender, identity, and the ontological status of synthetic beings.",

This work appropriates that familiar hardware, “impaling” a squab model on the prongs. In Sinitic cuisines, squab is a prized staple—especially in Cantonese and Hong Kong dishes—valued as high-protein and low-fat. For migrants, like many foods of home, it binds language and community, conjuring a sense of “home” that softens loneliness and estrangement. Yet when squab-as-food meets the wider emblem of the pigeon as purity and peace, the rifts and biases around cultural identity come into view.",

As one of the young generation artists sponsored by K11 Art Foundation, aaajiao is a leading new media artist in China. His work features exploration and application of data in various forms, endeavoring to present a full picture of his practice and his thought behind it through the modulation/demodulation of data and reality. Known for his ingenious and innovative experiment in integrating computer software with art, in this upcoming solo exhibition, aaajiao will be presenting six of his latest works. Different from the artist’s previous solo exhibitions which showcased logical enquiries and research on data itself, The Screen Generation will share with the audience a more personal experience. The exhibition will open to public on December 14, 2013 and run through February 15, 2014. In the meantime, a series of public education events and seminars will be held during the exhibition at both chi K11 Art Space and Minsheng Art Museum.",

    "description_en": "The expressionist movement has undergone a century of changes, just like the Shanghai Art Museum over the past century. Through the refinement of time, it remains ever new. The images capture the thread of 'time', attempting to showcase this change through a reconstructed method. By using three-dimensional projections on the facade of the Shanghai Art Museum, montage techniques such as outlining, distortion, surface reconstruction, waveform oscillation, and axial hierarchical expansion are employed to recreate the evolution of the exhibition works. The fragmented narrative structure and non-linear organization of the timeline allow for a reconstruction of the concept of time.",

    "description_en": "The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum can be seen as a summary of the aesthetic exploration made by the Screen Generation Series. Compared with the previous two presentations, The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum addresses the interactive relation between man and screen in a more direct and clearer way. In the Screen Generation Series, the artist raises two propositions. The first is to transform application-generated data into images and sounds on screen and to give people sensual and emotional experience through constant presentation. The other is that as a generation having long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. In other words, as digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself. Aaajiao’s work aptly evades concepts such as “personification” and “objectification” that would easily cause confusion and misunderstanding of new media art. In this piece, a complex issue as the interplay between man and screen, or say between man and technology, is skillfully encapsulated in something as subtle as a piece of jewelry. The wearing of these jewelry pieces epitomizes a connection between man and screen. By combining visual images (which are cool and rational as always), sense of taste (of the sugar crystals), psychological hint (given by the action of licking and fondling), and compulsion (on both physical and mental levels), Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum manages to cast light on equality, co-existence and co-development of the relation between screen and man in a humorous way.",
    "description_cn": "《屏幕一代》@9平米美术馆是《屏幕一代》系列作品在美学探索上的一次小结。与前两次的展览比较而言，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的相互关系阐述得更加情绪明确。在《屏幕一代》系列作品中，艺术家最初为观众提出了两个命题，一是应用程序生成数据，转换成屏幕上的图像和声音，通过不断的自我展示，带给人类感官与情感的体验。另外一个命题讨论早已被信息化的“我们”逐渐变成信息的节点，使用屏幕的同时也成为屏幕本身，从而与屏幕彼此构成生态系统的现状。本次作品避开了新媒体艺术中容易让人产生理解偏差的“拟人”和“拟物”的观点，将屏幕与人，即科技与人类相互关系的大命题巧妙地落在一件细微之物——首饰上。一贯冷静理性的视觉形象，结晶糖块的味觉体验，吮咬糖块和反复拨弄磁球的心理暗示，心理暗示造成的强迫性的精神反应与行为结果，通过首饰与人肌肤相亲这一个简单的联结，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的平等、共生和共同发展的社会关系举重若轻地地铺展开来。",

    "description_en": "First discovered in the Mediterranean in 1883, the Turritopsis Nutricula is a hydrozoan, whose Medusa (jellyfish) is effectively immortal. When threatened, the Medusa’s cells can age backwards from sexual maturity to those halcyon days of jellyfish childhood. From there, they age again, then regress again, ad infinitum. This happens through a process called transdifferentiation, in which one type of cell switches to another type. For this piece, aaajiao created an algorithmically generated swarm of these creatures. As the pixelated bloom floats by, one thinks about how the digital age confounds the linear march of time. The two poles of Turritopis‘s existence–youth and sexual maturity–find parallel in our division between the virtual world and the physical.",

    "description_en": "Three strands are braided into a single cut: Sun Santo’s sacred tune Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ritual performance of Ksitigarbha inherited from his grandmother; and everyday clips Gongze posted to his friend circle. The narrative takes its cue from Gongze’s account of peers in Harbin: drifting through club culture, turning to livestream commerce, then—amid economic shifts—entering the “chuma xian” spirit-medium system to “see/soothe,” a role akin to informal counseling. Ag threads these with a framework of Ksitigarbha devotion and an urban sensorium of “ruin—bardo.” The trajectory mirrors phases of the Simplified-Chinese internet and public discourse, charting the currents of “folk spirituality—platform economy—generational livelihood,” and placing the consolatory function of Crying Smoke-Soul in counterpoint to a social role likened to a “psychiatrist.” Ag’s method draws on a Jiangnan rite for Ksitigarbha—“inserting stick incense” into the earth—both a family lineage and a way to intervene on site. In 2016, Ag enacted it at the former “Qijia Village” in Putuo. Shanghai, in Ag’s grasp, is a “bardo/illusory city”: center and fold, underground and edge, gleam and height as a single continuum, where roles and scenes turn on the axis “ruin—bardo—vow-power.” The “temporary ruins” left by the Dinghai Bridge relocation anchor the shoot and interlock with an incense rite on Ksitigarbha’s birthday, proposing a bodily way of seeing that “finds soil’s seams in concrete.” In the post-pandemic city, driverless metros and the “ghost train” rhyme with a “headless, tailless film,” linking to a clear-eyed practice of “seeing better in the dark”—a chain of metaphors that gives the image its “bardo-in-ruins” cadence. The finished edit lays its sound bed with Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ruin-body performance steers the image; and friend-circle clips puncture the surface as reality’s burrs. Folk belief, urban experience, and platformed life are made concurrent, elaborating a viewing mode and narrative in which “vow-power moves through the bardo.”",
    "description_cn": "这件作品由三部分素材拼合而成：使用孙三通的神调《哭烟魂》、Ag祖传自奶奶的地藏仪轨行为视频- Ksitigarbha，以及宫泽发布于朋友圈的生活片段，最终被重新剪辑成单一的视频。其叙事线索来自宫泽讲述的东北（哈尔滨）同辈从俱乐部文化到直播带货再到转入“出马仙”式的“心理咨询/安抚”角色的转变，并由Ag以地藏信仰与“废墟—中阴（bardo）”的城市感受为精神框架将三者串联。",

Reflecting on this intersection, local and global networks, social media, gardening structures, parks, and nature all become amalgamated into a digital hyper-representation. The work borrows aesthetics from existing role-playing action games, reflecting a world that is at once familiar yet slightly dystopian. In this digital space, the boundaries between the physical and the virtual blur, leading viewers to question the nature of memory in the age of machine learning.",

The domain name ddrk.me is self-deprecating and does not refer to you as a visitor to the site, so please do not take it personally.\" I habitually checked the domain name's whois information, recorded it, later printed it on industrial films, and included them in the space.

The appearance and basic functions of this installation are similar to that of Capsule Vending Machine. This kind of easy-to-use self-service vending machines can be found in convenience shops across the entire city. Different from general Capsule Vending Machines, this Memory Vending Machine sells capsules, which, based on the conception by the artist, seem empty inside but have actually encapsulated numerous tiny nano-robots. Inhaled by the user of the air inside the capsule, these nano-robots carrying special data will enter and colonize the human brains, and propagate themselves to form memory zones. In addition, different individuals can communicate with each other, which actually means people can enter each other’s memories and fully read sensory information including vision, hearing, feeling, tasting, olfaction, etc., and acquire the whole “real” experience (revivification) on its own organic body. Descriptive animation is played on the electronic screen of the installation, elaborating the visitors on the principles and purposes of this “invention”.",

It focuses on the visual part, but through the process of presenting visual composition to study the visualization problems we face, whether the visualized data is related to the truth or not. It's just another process for decay of the visual (1984 - George Orwell, \"decay of the language\" / \"decline of the language\").",

    "description_en": "In 2013, media artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) launched an art project titled The Screen Generation which was exhibited many times in Beijing and Shanghai. As exhibitions went on, aaajiao developed the scope of The Screen Generation from installations to performances and from vision to touch. The jewelry exhibited here are conceptual extension based on the 6 video installations, namely Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise, of that project. The Screen Generation aims to explore the relationship between man and information. In his view, aaajiao believes that the existence of mankind is highly informationized and has formed an ecological system together with the Screen. We are the Screen Generation and have become the screen itself. The 6 pieces titled Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise respectively represent certain human character and emotion. Through reading each other we have built an equal relationship of communication. The 6 pieces of jewelry with the same titles as the installations are results of collaboration between media artist aaajiao and jewelry designer Shen Lei. When the jewelry is placed on the table, they become an independent jewelry installation. The models of the jewelry come from Meta, an algorithm performance of The Screen Generation. But the artists abandoned previous visual logics; instead they resorted to pure touch experience. For example, in addition to 3D-printed resin, the eardrops titled Hard have sugar paste coating on part of the material. The sugar coating can be sucked on to create unique shapes; The ring titled Repeatedly is made of permanent magnet which compels one to play with it repeatedly as if he suffers from OCD; The Noise fights one’s palm with spikes to finally reach equality between man and information. The artists subverted the stereotype of jewelry which is “precious metal to decorate human body”. They not only have trendy looks, but also try to interact with human body and have dialogues at every unintentional touch.",
    "description_cn": "2013年，媒体艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)开展了艺术项目《屏幕一代》，在北京、上海举办了多次展览。随着展览的一次次深入，aaajiao(徐文恺)将《屏幕一代》的呈现从装置拓展到表演，并从视觉转换到触觉。此次展出的首饰就是基于《屏幕一代》“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”六件视频装置的首饰概念延展。《屏幕一代》旨在探讨人与信息的关系。在aaajiao(徐文恺)看来，人类的存在已经高度信息化，与屏幕彼此构成生态系统，我们既是屏幕一代，也已经成为屏幕本身。展览中的六件作品“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”分别抽象出人类的某种性格和情绪，人类与屏幕在互相阅读中已经形成了一种平等的沟通关系。与作品同名的六件首饰由艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)与首饰设计师沈磊合作完成，六件首饰置于桌面，其本身又构成了一件独立的首饰装置。首饰的模型基本上来源于《屏幕一代》中的算法表演Meta。但艺术家摒弃了此前的视觉逻辑，而诉诸于单纯的触觉体验。譬如，“坚硬”的耳坠部分除了3D打印树脂之外特意包裹了部分翻糖晶体，人们可以通过吮食糖来塑造独一无二的形态；永磁体构造的指环“反复”迫使人强迫症般地旋转把玩；而“闹”则凭借浑身的利刺与人的掌心彼此搏斗角力，最终实现人与信息的平衡。",

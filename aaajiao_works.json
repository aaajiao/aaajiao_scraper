    "description_en": "404 is the error message which appears on blocked websites in China. Translating the digital message back into analog form, 404 (2017) is aaajiao’s subtle commentary on censorship and the flow of information in our digital culture. The message is always the same, no matter the diversity of content it is covering from view. Entirely site-specific, this work takes a new form with each installation; multiplying the message 404 in a diversity of forms and contexts. - DR. RACHEL RITS-VOLLOCH",

    "description_en": "For his exhibition with the gallery, Chinese Berlin based artist aaajiao seeks to face the infinitely expanding authority of computational power, and how its recent forms train us to have only feeble computing capabilities. Focusing on the internet, our closest and most visible form of computational power, aaajiao realizes works of art which track how people's behaviours are alienated from real life by the platform algorithms of the attention economy and the proliferation of pervasive ideological conflicts, turning life into merely an information bit, flickering and dancing. In the exhibition, aaajiao searches through the creation of video, paintings and sculpture for a void in such a system, for a void of the internet, where streams may still flow which dissociate from systemic authority, soothe our wounds, and dissolve these constructed configurations of distraction and hatred.\n\nIn the face of infinitely expanding computational power (authority), each of us may become a minority with only feeble computing capabilities. If we focus on the internet, the closest and most visible form of computational power, people's behaviors are being alienated by the platform algorithms of the attention economy and the pervasive ideological conflicts, turning into a bit, flickering and dancing. Computational power, carrying social media, has filled the entire internet and is rapidly spreading to almost all fields in the form of generative AI. In the exhibition, I try to search for void in such a system, the void of the internet, where streams still flow that dissociate from systemic authority, soothe wounds, and dissolve hatred.\n\nMinority Algorithm, a video work discussing the void of the internet, includes stories of decentralized Counterhistory compositions in social struggles formed by the smartphone peeping perspective based on short video apps, the astonishing fact that drone killing videos in war are rapidly spread and gamified through social media with the blessing of algorithms, and the fictional narratives formed by AI computing power shaping artificial landscapes and natural disasters, as well as the devastation brought to individual laborers by the fundamental step of AI training that cannot be bypassed—manual annotation, and the alienation of people's perception of the physical world after being shaped by computing power. While I see the omnipresent computing power and algorithms, I also notice that the human heart is everywhere, and the flow of empathy and curiosity tears through the neat, proud, and expensive authority, revealing void and smelling the streams.\n\nMidjourney founder David Holz once described AI as water in an interview [1], and the young generation of protesters in Hong Kong adopted actor, martial arts star, and philosopher Bruce Lee's \"Be Water My Friend\" [2] as the action methodology for the decentralized political movement that began in 2019 [3], while tech giants still rely on water cooling today to cool the ever-expanding data centers [4]. Many types of water are mentioned here: water as an understanding of resources, with some wanting to be surfers; water as a philosophy of action for people; and water as the life-giving water that humans use to express their desires to transform themselves and once again offend the climate. Water or streams, like the human heart or the synthesis of human behavior, in the context of the Anthropocene, the computational power contained in the flow, along with algorithms, gradually forms an extension of the natural climate, and each use of a Prompt to generate a process sends the moment a butterfly flaps its wings over the Pacific further away. The title of the exhibition, A Prompt, is also the moment of a faint individual's self-empowerment, an attempt to pose questions while not giving up on answering them.\n\nThe Seed [5] series is a co-creation with AI, using two public AIGC tools, Midjourney and Stable Definition, to generate the basic visual parts through writing prompts. Then, through one's own understanding, respond to the generated content based on the prompts to form an image. Finally, the image is enlarged through AI algorithms, and techniques such as manual silkscreen printing are used to create a visual artwork.\n\nPrompt Engineering is a video installation whose content is entirely generated by AI algorithms, from character images to voiceover animations, as well as voice synthesis. These are also the three important implementation paths in current AIGC, and they are the meta data that make human audiences most easily feel Hallucination. This then forms a closed loop, where the AI character generates its own prompts through its voiceover.\n\nThe video installations \"Fine-tuning\" and \"Agent\" both borrow proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named \"Internet void\" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction [6]. This serves as a visual interpretation of the \"Internet void.\" \"Fine-tuning\" deconstructs the definition of fine-tuning in the application of LLM by documenting the manual adjustment of the character's facial and body parameters (craftsmanship) during the character creation process. The installation \"Agent,\" composed of two flexible screens, discusses the relationship between hallucinations created by AI algorithms in graphic generation and human imagination.\n\nThe exhibition also retains two earlier works as a backdrop to the narrative. Landscape 003 is a depiction of the internet landscape under the attention economy, using the limited dimensions of a mobile phone screen to create pixel art as a visual basis, typically no more than 128*128 pixels. Such stringent constraints respond to the fragmentation of attention as a common phenomenon following the internet's shaping and domestication of human reading and viewing capabilities. This is further processed through partial ASCII treatment, then manually screen-printed onto small, cut pieces of silicone skin, and finally assembled into the complete image. The Inflation installation bots, apply the technique of 'Borrowed Scenery' flexibly from the creation of Eastern gardens, employing transparent PVC materials to create multiple metallic fluid forms of Inflation that are stacked on top of each other, analogous to the classic perspective of the internet—if you're not paying for the product, then you are the product itself [7] [8].\n\n[1] https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz\n\n[2] https://chloegarnham.medium.com/why-bruce-lee-said-be-like-water-f0d92ec84daa#:~:text=Bruce%20Lee%20famously%20said%3A,outward%20things%20will%20disclose%20themselves.\n\nBe like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.\n\n[6] A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water.  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fungus\n\nhttps://books.google.de/books?id=gI_jNL7PN2QC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=tv+you+are+the+product&source=bl&ots=FHKejNRHOb&sig=J53UVdUf7QAEJ3c7LxNKP-xINu0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PWVbVf7jH4rfsAXUt4GwBg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=tv%20you%20are%20the%20product&f=false\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/03/05/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-you-become-the-product/",
    "description_cn": "在无限膨胀的运算力（权力）面前，我们每一个人都可能成为仅拥有微弱算力的少数群体，如果我们聚焦当下最接近可见的运算力的互联网，人们的行为正在被注意力经济下的平台算法以及无处不在的意识形态混战而异化成为了一个bit，闪烁跳动。运算力裹挟着社交媒体塞满了整个互联网并且正在以生成式ai的形式迅速蔓延到几乎所有领域，我尝试在展览中去找寻在如此的系统面前，是否存在缝隙，互联网的缝隙，缝隙中依旧流淌着解离系统权威，抚慰伤痛，化解仇恨的溪流。\n\nMinority Algorithm 弱者算法， 是一件讨论互联网缝隙的视频作品，其中有基于短视频应用所逐渐形成的手机窥探视角在社会抗争中去中心化的构成 Counterhistory 的故事，战争中无人机的杀戮视频在算法的加持下迅速通过社交媒体传播并游戏化的惊人事实，以及通过AI算力塑造人造景观与自然灾害形成的虚构叙事，还有AI训练无法绕过的基础步骤——人工标注带给个体劳动者的摧残，人们被算力塑造后对物理世界感受的异化。我看到了无处不在的运算力和算法的同时，也注意到人的心无处不在，同理心和好奇心的流荡撕裂了整齐高傲昂贵的权威，漏出缝隙也闻到了溪流。\n\nMidjourney founder David Holz 曾在采访中形容AI如水 [1] ，香港年轻一代抗争者把演员、武术明星兼哲学家 Bruce Lee 的 Be Water My Friend [2]作为2019年开始的去中心化的政治运动的行动方法论 [3] ，而科技巨头今天依然仰赖水冷来给不断扩充的数据中心降温 [4]。这里提到了很多种水，水作为一种对资源的理解，有人想做冲浪者；水作为一种人们的行动哲学；还有水作为人类施展欲望改造自我并再次冒犯气候的生命之水。水或者溪流，如同人心或者人类行为的综合，在Anthropocene的背景下，流动中蕴藏的运算力连同算法逐渐形成了自然气候的扩展，而每一次使用 Prompt 去生成的过程，都令太平洋上空蝴蝶震动翅膀的瞬间传送的更远。展览标题中的 A Prompt，也是微弱个体自我赋权的震动瞬间，尝试提出问题，同时不放弃回答。\n\nSeed [5] 系列是与AI 进行的共同创作，使用两个公开的AIGC工具，Midjourney 和 stable definition 通过书写Prompt生成基础视觉部份，在通过自己的理解回应基于prompt的生成内容，最终构成图像，再经过ai算法放大，手工丝网印刷等技巧制成一件视觉作品。\n\nPrompt Engineering 是一件视频装置，内容完全源于AI 算法生成，从角色形象到念白动画，以及人声合成，这也是当下AIGC中三个重要的实现路径，也是让人类观众最容易感受到 Hallucination 的meta data，后形成一个闭环，即 AI 形象自己念白生成自己的prompt。\n\nFine-tuning  和 Agent 两件视频装置都借用了大模型文档或者Cookie Book中的专有名词作为作品名称，另外我虚构了名为 互联网缝隙 的livd2d角色作为视频装置的主角，角色借鉴了真菌独立于植物、动物和其他真核生物，也不能进行光合作用，其成长型态与植物一样不能移动，但可以透过菌丝的延长拓展栖地，也能透过经由有性或无性生殖产生的孢子进行长距离的传播 [6] 的属性作为对互联网缝隙视觉化的理解。 Fine-tuning 通过对角色制作过程中手动调整角色面部肢体参数（手艺）的记录来解构AI 大模型应用中 Fine-tuning 的定义；由两块柔性屏组成的装置 Agent，则讨论了AI 算法在图形生成上造就的 Hallucination 与人类想象力的关系。\n\n展览中还保留了两件早前的作品，作为展览叙事的背景，landscape 003 是对注意力经济下互联网的景观的描述，用手机屏幕有限的尺幅绘制像素画作为视觉基础，一般不超过128*128个像素，如此苛刻的限制回应了注意力的碎片化成为互联网对人类阅读观察能力的塑造和驯化后的普遍现象。再通过局部ASCii的处理，之后手工丝网印刷在裁切过的小块硅胶皮上，最后拼接出整幅画面。气膜装置bots, 活用了东方园林造景的时“借景” (Borrowed Scenery) 的手法，使用透明PVC材料制成的多个金属流体形态的气膜并且互相堆叠，比拟互联网的经典视角，如果你没有为产品付费，那么你就是产品本身 [7] [8]。",

    "description_en": "Tabula Rasa Gallery London is delighted to present Deep Simulator, a solo exhibition of works by the Chinese artist aaajiao opening on June 6th for the inaugural edition of London Gallery Weekend 2021. The exhibition lasts until July 30th 2021.\n\nIn a room set up with a gaming station and standalone, surreal objects evocative of tree branches rendered by digital algorithm, aaajiao’s metagame Deep Simulator invites the viewer to partake in a space exploration at once both real and virtual.\n\nDeep Simulator sees computational power as the prime engine that generates the state of our world. The six possible states of Bardo—a term originated from Buddhism that describes the intermediate state between death and rebirth—can be retrieved by the player via six levels of computational power. “Deep Wanderer,” defined as the protagonist of the metagame, is an amalgamated persona consisting of the viewer of the exhibition, the player at the game station, and the wanderer in the metaphorical journey within the simulation. Upon seeing and being the “Deep Wanderer”, individuals such as us come closer to understanding the truth of our existence.\n\nAs the artist’s continuous reflection on the evolution of human identity along the transformative power of the Internet sphere, the forming of The Player in Deep Simulation is a transmutative process carried out by the artist over the years. It passes through the figure of The User presented on the artist’s solo exhibition User, Love, High-frequency Trading in 2017, and The Bot as an information crawler for the project bot in 2018. The spectator’s ability to see the player playing while awaiting his or her own turn opens up a path to observe an “other” him- or herself, and underlines the controversial notion of the real in the world of new technologies, the Internet and the circulation of digital data.\n\nIt is worth noting that Deep Simulator was specially conceived for the project room of Castello di Rivoli in 2020, making aaajiao the first Chinese artist to exhibit at an Italian institution. Due to the pandemic, only domestic visitors in Italy were allowed. We hope that through presenting the work for a second time at our London space, the work will be able to reach a broader audience.",
    "description_cn": "Tabula Rasa 伦敦画廊荣幸地宣布，将于6月4日至7月30日呈现中国艺术家 aaajiao 的个展《深渊模拟器》（Deep Simulator），并将参与首届伦敦画廊周（London Gallery Weekend）。\n\n在《深渊模拟器》中，计算机算力被视作创造出世界形态的主引擎。玩家可以经由六层算力，抵达“中阴”——佛学中死亡与新生之中间态——的六种可能状态。元游戏的主角，“深渊游荡者”（Deep Wanderer），是一个集合了展览的观众、游戏台前的玩家以及在模拟空间旅途中的游荡者的混合人格。通过观看并成为“深渊游荡者”，我们作为个人，得以靠近并逐步理解我们存在的真相。\n\n多年来，aaajiao持续思考着人类身份的进化以及互联网的变革力量。《深渊模拟器》中的“玩家”这一身份的塑成正是来自于一个长期进行、不断变化的过程，经历了2017年的个展《用户、爱、高频交易》（User, Love, High-frequency Trading）中的“用户”，以及2018年的作品《观察者》（bot,）中作为信息爬虫的“Bot”的迭代。当观众旁观玩家进行游戏、等待自己的轮次时，也获得了一个观察作为“他者”的自己的机会。在其中，是艺术家对于互联网、数码数据的流通以及“真实”这个在新技术遍布的世界中矛盾重重的概念的关注。\n\n值得一提的是，《深渊模拟器》是为意大利都灵里沃利城堡当代美术馆（Castello di Rivoli Museo d'Arte Contemporanea）的项目空间特别制作的作品。由于疫情的原因，展览仅对意大利本地的参观者开放。通过此次在伦敦空间的第二次展出，我们希望能让更多的观众体验到这件作品。",

    "description_en": "Efremidis Gallery is pleased to present A.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration by Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist and activist aaajiao.\n\nBorn in 1984 in Xi’an, China, aaajiao is the virtual persona of Xu Wenkai. His work is often a pointed reflection on the ever-expanding role media plays in our lives. A particular focus in his work lies with an exploration of the internet, how data is processed, the blogosphere and China’s Great Fire Wall.\n\nA.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration, consisting of ten screens placed across the almost 14-meter long wall facing out towards Ernst-Reuter-Platz, explores, utilizes and critiques Google’s AVA program.\n\nAVA or Atomic Visual Actions is part of the Perception Team at Google AI. As is clearly stated on their website, their long-term technology mission is to enable machines to achieve human-level intelligence in sensory perception, at super-human scales. In particular, they are excited about imbuing computers with “social visual intelligence” or the ability to perceive what humans are doing, what might they do next and what they are trying to achieve.\n\nFollowing the initial interest and hype of the 1980s, the interest in AI died down after inflated expectations were not met. After this so-called ‘AI winter’, interest has reawakened, and already a point has been reached where artificial intelligence is informing many of the decisions we make, and it is continuing its infiltration into our daily lives. For AI to learn, large already processed data sets are needed. AVA receives its raw datasets from a freely accessible, enormous, continuously updated and diverse databank; YouTube. Ultimately the ground level for AI is human. ‘Data workshops’ have popped up, particularly in China, where young workers sit and view images, tagging them with dots, lines, and descriptions.\n\nThe processed output of AVA can be found online. At the moment of writing, entries are included for a range of actions, including smoking, dancing, listening to, sing, reach, crouch and kneel.\n\naaajiao takes the freely available, already processed datasets from AVA and manipulates the image. While maintaining the visual language of AVA, with its use of the purple bounding boxes, he eliminates the desired information. An overload of images is flashing increasingly more rapid before the viewer. Mundane movements take on an air of suspicion hidden from view.\n\nThe work A.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration is installed on the ground floor of the former IBM building on Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here, in the 1960s, the first data processors were installed, clearly on view to all passersby in West-Berlin.\n\nNow we are the data, we provide the data, we analyze the data and are continuously more influenced by our own data. Logged in, cookies saved, and continuously tracked, our lives are lived more and more online. The potential influence our own data may have over us is looming before us.",

    "description_en": "\"Agent\" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named \"Internet void\" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction [6]. This serves as a visual interpretation of the \"Internet void.\"\n\nThe installation \"Agent,\" composed of two flexible screens, discusses the relationship between hallucinations created by AI algorithms in graphic generation and human imagination.\n\n[6] A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water.  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fungus",

Clouds generated by the artist’s computing language are seen flying over the screens… So how do we feel the textile dimension, the color, or even temperature…of a virtual object? Apparently, we very much rely on the knowledge understanding of the technology application, but maybe in the not far future, a sixth sense will finally be stimulated in human body to deal with the cyber reality.",
    "description_cn": "在作品《云》中，12块冰冷的纯平显示器模拟出了一小片昏暗的天空。与此同时，这个矩阵却也在数字时空中为我们营造了一片无边无垠的三维天空。由艺术家（或者更准确的说，是由计算机程序语言）生成的“白云”在虚拟空际缓慢漂过……那我们究竟该怎么去感知一个虚拟物体的质地、色彩、维度，甚至是温度呢？显然，我们目前还必须依赖知识（对现代数字化技术的了解）来做出判断。但或许在不久的将来，人体将能够“模拟”出某种“第六感”，使我们更好的去感知“数字时空”。",

The portability of the medium (liquid crystal display being the new scroll painting, as it were) is negated by either fastening the screens to suspended girders, or placing them on concrete plinths. These pieces simultaneously engage the massive construction projects going on across China (and with that, the wanton destruction of traditional neighborhoods) and the peaceful contemplation seen in traditional Chinese painting and writing. They also represent the exciting modes of cultural transmission in the contemporary world. At once, these pieces evoke Alfred Stieglitz’s Equivalents and sculptural Minimalism. Liam Gillick, in describing the work of Donald Judd, puts it nicely. “You are not supposed to fixate on the structures in isolation or to over rationalise them within the late modernist tendency towards reduction. The work functions best when it is allowed to hover between its connection to its given location and the rest of the relative experience we bring to the room.”",

    "description_en": "\"Fine-tuning\" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named \"Internet void\" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction [6]. This serves as a visual interpretation of the \"Internet void.\"\n\n\"Fine-tuning\" deconstructs the definition of fine-tuning in the application of LLM by documenting the manual adjustment of the character's facial and body parameters (craftsmanship) during the character creation process.\n\n[6] A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water.  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fungus",

    "description_en": "On 06.01.2018, the 1000+ Experimental Project Space of A Thousand Plateaus Art Space will launch the first new-year plan with a solo project - “Gluttony” from the artist Aaajiao. Instead of pursuing the maturity and integrity, this Experimental Project Space focuses on the experimental composition of emerging artists with a more open attitude to explore the possibility of the creation and presentation and to strive for a unique exhibition experience.\n\nAaajiao, is the pseudonym of the young artist Xu Wenkai and the avatar of his virtual network. He was born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities, Xi’an, but now lives and works in Shanghai and Berlin. The composition of Aajiao contains a strong dystopian awareness and a profound reflection on literati spirits and sophistications. Many of his works are devoted to the exploration of cultural and social phenomena around the influence of new technology and media. These works, ranging from the social media writing and the data processing to the new aesthetic landscape through the Internet and mobile media, bring the special Chinese social media culture and technology the international art discussions.\n\nThe composition of Aaajiao also crosses different medias with its abundant number and forms. In 2017, he composed the video work of \"archives, Candy Wrappers\", “Progress Bar”, \"Column\", \"Candy Wrappers\", and \"Lorem Ipsum\"; the installation of \"404 Installation\", \" Water Measure - Petroleum\", and \"Membranization\"; the sound installation of \"Collective Behavior\"; as well as the Gif animation work of \"Avatar” and more. Based on the online network and its visual and cultural phenomenon, these works are all attempt to explore the sociology and the visual and image morphology.\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, \"Gluttony \" as a new 1000+ experimental project will continue this clue in thousand plateau art space, and explore “how self as an observer gets along with the self devouring the pain through the gluttony?”. This new solo project, belongs to the \"Membranization” series -- from the use of machines, to the collusion of machines, and even to be held hostage by the machines, there are subtle changes of human emotions in terms of facing the machines. It is unable to use these rotten fermentations of social media to record those changes, however, the combination of some materials clearly depicts the emotional contours, and the light properties of the material itself also implies the disguised emotions.\n\nAaajiao’s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world, upcoming and recent shows include “Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today”, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, Boston (2018); “unREAL”, Haus der elektronischen Künste, Basel (2017); “Shanghai Project Part II”, Shanghai (2017); “Temporal Turn: Art and Speculation in Contemporary Asia”, Spencer Museum of Art, Kansas (2016); “Take Me (I’m Yours)” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jens Hoffmann and Kelly Taxter), Jewish Museum, New York (2016); “Overpop”, Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2016); “Hack Space” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Amira Gad), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space, Hong Kong and chi K11 art museum, Shanghai (2016); “Globale: Global Control and Censorship”, ZKM | Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (2015); “Thingworld International Triennial of New Media Art”, The National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2014); and Transmediale, Berlin (2010). His solo exhibition includes: “Remnants of an Electronic Past”, Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art, Manchester (2016); OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal Xi’an, Xi’an (2016), among others.",
    "description_cn": "2018年1月6日，千高原艺术空间的1000+实验项目空间将启动新年的第一个计划，带来艺术家aaajiao的个人项目“暴食／Gluttony”。千高原的实验项目空间以新锐艺术家的实验性创作为主，不追求作品与主题的成熟度或完整性，而是以更加开放的姿态，探索创作与展示的可能性，并努力带来特殊的观展体验。\n\naaajiao，是年轻艺术家徐文恺的化名，也是他虚构的网络分身。他于1984年出生于中国最古老城市之一的西安，现生活和工作在上海与柏林两地。aaajiao的创作结合了浓重的反乌托邦意识，以及对文人精神的反思。他的很多作品都致力于探索新的科技和媒体影响之下的文化与社会现象。作品涵盖了社交媒体写作，数据处理，以及网络和移动媒介下的新美学景观，将今天中国特殊的社交媒体文化和科技带入了国际艺术的讨论当中。\n\naaajiao的创作跨越不同的媒介，且数量和形态都非常丰富。在2017年，他的作品主要有影像作品“档案糖纸”，“进度条”，“柱”，“糖纸”，“乱数假文”；装置作品“404”，“水侧.石油”，“膜化”；声音装置“集群行为”；Gif动画作品“头像”等十余件，都围绕着以网络及其视觉和文化现象为基础的，对社会学话题，或者视觉与图像形态的探索。而在2018年的伊始，“Gluttony / 暴食”作为新的1000+实验项目将在千高原艺术空间继续这一线索，探究“作为自我的观察者将如何与吞噬痛苦的暴食自我相处？”，此项目从属于 “Membranization / 膜化系列”——从使用机器，到与机器共谋，甚至被机器所挟持，人类的情绪在面对机器时发生着微妙的变化，记录这些变化已经无法使用那些腐烂发酵的社交媒体，一些材料的组合却能够清晰刻画些许情绪的轮廓，材料本身的轻质属性同样暗示着情绪的隐蔽性。\n\naaajiao的创作作品频繁展出于全球的美术馆和艺术机构，例如：《1989年到今天：网络时代的艺术》，美国波士顿当代艺术中心 ICA Boston，2018；《非真实》，瑞士巴塞尔电子艺术之家（HeK），2017；《身体·媒体II》，上海当代艺术博物馆，2017；《上海种子》，2017；《带我走（我是你的）》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Jens Hoffmann策展），美国纽约犹太人美术馆，2016；《时间转向：当代亚洲的艺术与思辨》，美国堪萨斯斯班塞美术馆，2016；《波普之上》，上海余德耀美术馆，2016；《黑客空间》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Amira Gad策展），香港K11艺术基金会临时空间及上海chi K11美术馆，2016；《全方位：全控制和言论控制》，德国ZKM卡尔斯鲁厄艺术与媒体中心，2015；《齐物等观——2014国际新媒体艺术三年展》，北京中国国家美术馆，2014，等。",

    "description_en": "\"Guard\" is a installation artwork created using silicone, 3D printing, and fiberglass, depicting the figure of a security guard bearing the artist's own face. The inspiration for this piece comes from the unique role and circumstances of security guards in Chinese society during the COVID-19 lockdowns. During this period, security guards—typically individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, veterans, or increasingly unemployed college graduates—were suddenly granted temporary authority by local governments. Empowered overnight, these guards rapidly transformed from community caretakers into authoritarian enforcers, imposing harsh and sometimes brutal measures upon the very residents they once served, resulting in numerous tragedies.\n\nThe artist compares this months-long, severe lockdown to a \"Stanford Prison Experiment\" involving billions of people, using the artwork to explore the moral dilemmas and struggles of individuals under extreme authoritarian conditions. By placing his own face onto the security guard figure, the artist reflects upon his own potential complicity: if placed in an increasingly extreme environment, would he also be forced to don the guard's uniform, feign sleep, avoid confronting reality, or even become an executor of oppressive power?\n\nThrough \"Guard,\" the artist seeks to provoke contemplation on the human predicament under authoritarian rule, while also critically examining his own position as someone who has left Shanghai, now lives in Berlin, and holds the privilege of narrating the pains and traumas of this era.",

Dressed in a standard security uniform, the figure sits in a chair, as if drifting into a nap.\n\nIn China, security work was once largely taken by veterans and older rural migrants. Since the pandemic, it has also become a fallback for unemployed youth—jokingly grouped online with cleaners and nannies as the “Auspicious Three Treasures.” A meme on the Simplified-Chinese internet quips: “Young people becoming security guards, skipping forty years of detours.” During lockdowns, guards—under verbal administrative mandate—managed gates and order within residential compounds, becoming, at the scale of the neighborhood, “the smallest unit of fascism,” and a locus of trauma for many who were sealed in. Yet the work is often monotonous and solitary. Many young guards turned to personal channels and vlogs, hoping the attention economy might lift low wages and grant visibility.",

    "description_cn": "枯山水 (karesansui?) or \"dry landscape\" garden, often called a zen garden, creates a miniature stylised landscape through carefully composed arrangements of rocks, water features, moss, pruned trees and bushes, and uses gravel or sand that is raked to represent ripples in water.Create a peaceful, quiet at the moment, contains a \"trend\" that is what engraved movement, this \"potential\", is power: a power of growth, but also in the rest of the instant motion, inaction.\n\n枯山水原指由细沙碎石铺地，再加上一些叠放有致的石组所构成的缩微式园林景观，没有水景，其中的“水”通常由砂石表现，而“山”通常用石块表现，创造一种宁静，而此刻的宁静，蕴含一种“趋势”，即一下刻的运动，这种“势”，是力量 ：一种生⻓的力量, 也是运动中静止的瞬间，以静制动。",

While I see the omnipresent computing power and algorithms, I also notice that the human heart is everywhere, and the flow of empathy and curiosity tears through the neat, proud, and expensive authority, revealing void and smelling the streams.",

    "description_en": "Built on iconic clips by Guo Laoshi and Yaoshui-ge, catchphrases like “yesmola,” “mi hotel,” and “Are you worthy?” become kinetic typography—breath and beat for the screen. Through repetition, language amplifies itself, conjuring a “livestream ritual” that keeps generating. Seeing and being seen iterate between barrages and clips; the crowd touches a fleeting bond in the carnival, only to meet, in the hush after laughter, the lezi-ren’s (fun-seeker’s) alienation and hollow core—loneliness returning like an echo from noise.\n\n“Abstract culture” names an online subculture that is anti-logic, anti-narrative, anti-authority, dissolving mainstream speech through profanity, dialect, semantic slippage, and insider jargon. Emerging from the livestream wave circa 2015 and streamer scenes like “6324,” it grows through watching, mockery, and remixes. Its pull is an instant gratification of “anti-common sense—anti-refinement—anti-logic,” feeding a watchword of entertainment-first; viewers gain a brief illusion of commonality by repetition and remix. Yet most look on as lezi-ren, consuming others’ embarrassment with spoof and cold sneer. The ties are thin, the affect low: synchronous bustle alongside deep solitude. Abstract culture offers a chorus-ready template, but struggles to form durable bonds, reflecting how “person-to-person” relations hollow out in an atomized society.",
    "description_cn": "以郭老师与药水哥的标志性片段为骨架，将“耶斯莫拉”“迷hotel”“您配吗”等梗语以动态字体化作屏幕的呼吸与鼓点，让语言在复读中自我增幅，召唤出一场持续生成的“直播仪式”。看与被看在弹幕与切片之间迭代，围观者在狂欢中获得短暂连结，却在笑声散场的静默里照见“乐子人”式的疏离与空心，孤独像回声一样从喧嚣深处返场。\n\n抽象文化可被概括为一种反逻辑、反叙事、反权威的网络亚文化，通过脏话、方言、错位语义与黑话化再生产，完成对主流话语的“消解”与“滑移”。其渊源可追溯至2015年前后的直播潮与“6324”等主播社群生态，并在围观、嘲讽、二创的循环中被持续放大。抽象内容以“反常识—反精致—反逻辑”的即时愉悦为吸力，满足“娱乐至上”的观看逻辑，观众通过复读与二创获得短暂的共同体错觉。然而，围观者多以“乐子人”心态消费“他者的出丑”，以恶搞与冷嘲构筑脆弱的连接，情感承诺极低，导致共时热闹与纵深孤独并存。抽象文化提供了可快速合唱的语言模板，却难以生成稳定的社群纽带，映照出社会原子化语境中“人—人关系”的空洞化。",

    "description_en": "“Remnants of an Electronic Past”, a museum solo exhibition of Shanghai-based artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) at OCAT Xi’an, featuring a body of new works commissioned for the show. Opening June 18 and running through September 11th, 2016, “Remnants of an Electronic Past” also marks the first in a series of institutional solo exhibitions of aaajiao and museum group shows where the works will be featured in various forms throughout the year.\n\nLeading new media artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) returns to his native Xi’an this summer with a tribute to the significance embodied by the forest of steles at Beilin Museum, which offer unique examples of early texts; prototypes for fonts and a linguistic lexicon that is still referred to today. To the project, aaajiao brings his own inimical approach to contemporary technology and forms of technological media to muse, in his distinct expressive manner, what happens to outmoded versions of software as technology moves forward, becoming ever more sophisticated? Or, where does software go to die?\n\nMany of aaajiao’s works reflect a new thinking around the phenomenon of the Internet, acknowledging all its inherent controversies and contradictions, with specific projects focusing on data processing, the blogsphere and China’s Great Fire Wall. Hinting at the paradoxical nature of the new values attributed to technological advance vis-à-vis traditional knowledge, with the 2013 project “BlogArchaeological”, aaajiao wanted to know if one could use a standard measurement of value, that of gold, to measure the value of data. “I found a writer on a website and he’s been writing his blog for ten years. I collected all of his data, saved it onto a SD card, and put it on the scale. On the other side of the scale I placed some jewelery. We wanted to see how this data stacked up to the jewelry. The results were obvious: data is really light compared with the jewelry, but what I tried to express was that, right now, these blogs we create are worthless according to ancient views and measurements.”\n\nOther projects serve to re-imagine the capacity and direction of technology in an attempt to picture the future of human living, a category into which, aaajiao’s project for OCAT Xi’an fits well. “Remnants of an Electronic Past” references the contemporary appetite for consumption that humans have acquired; evident in the constant upgrade of everything that can be evolved. How urgent the task seems to keep up with all the latest technological developments… As aaajiao has said; “Right now most of us are used to relying on the maps in our cell phone, and I don’t how people lived without this technology in the old days. It can already be seen that people in the future cannot live without technology, and they can’t be separated from it.”\n\nThere is no way to measure this phenomenon in terms of a value judgment, meaning if it is good or bad. For the time being, it simply “is”, engendering a seam of futility and melancholy that reverberates in this elegantly imagined project. “Remnants of an Electronic Past” has particular resonance in Xi’an and the region, which is home to some of China’s most advanced technological innovation and thinking.",
    "description_cn": "艺术家aaajiao (徐文恺)将会在OCAT 西安馆展出个展《电子遗留物》。展览将集中呈现这一主题下的订制新作。展期从2016年6月18日至9月11日。《电子遗留物》将是今年aaajiao (徐文恺)该系列作品国际多个美术馆个展和群展中的第一站。\n\n这个夏天，新媒体艺术家aaajiao (徐文恺) 重返故乡西安，用自己的作品向碑林博物馆中所藏的石碑所赋有的重要意义致敬：它们不仅提供了独一无二的早期文字范例，而且其中所呈现的字体形态和语言词汇在今天依旧被提及。在此次项目中，aaajiao从自己对现代科技与技术媒体形式所持有的谨慎态度中获取灵感，用独特的表达方式去探索这样的问题：随着科学技术的不断发展，过时的软件会面临怎样的命运，是更显优势？还是走向消亡？\n\naaajiao的许多作品都表现出对网络这一现象的新思考，对其中存在的争议和矛盾都有涉及，也包含对数据处理、博客圈以及中国防火墙的关注。在其《博客考古》(2013) 项目中，aaajiao 暗示新价值观所具有的矛盾属性是由先进科技与传统知识产生的对立所造成。艺术家通过创作试图探索是否可以用测量黄金的标准去测量数据的价值。“我在一家网站上找到了一位作家，他已经写了十年的博客。我收集了他所有的数据并把它们保存到SD 卡里。之后把它放在了一个天平上。在天平的另一端我放了一些珠宝。我们想看看到底需要多少数据堆积起来才能和珠宝持平。结果显而易见，数据和珠宝的重量相差太大，但我想传达的是，在当下，我们所创造的博客如果以过去的方式去审视或以古老的方法去衡量，它们是毫无价值的”。\n\n在aaajiao所创作的其他项目中，他尝试对科技的能量与发展进行定义，并试图勾画出人类未来生活的景象，其中的部分主题则与OCAT西安馆想要传达的信息十分契合。“电子遗留物”呈现了人类所具有的消费欲望并表现了一种一切事物都可以被升级进化的现象。紧跟最新科技的脚步已然成为了当务之急。正如aaajiao所说，“现在我们大部分人都习惯依赖我们的手机地图，我不知道在以前没有这项技术的时候人们是怎样生活的。通过这些我们已经可以看到，在未来，人们的生活不能没有科技，当然也离不开它”。\n\n我们没有办法以价值判断来衡量这种现象并决定它的好坏。目前来看，它就这样存在着，形成一条将徒劳无功与阴沉悲伤缝合在一起的线，贯穿于这精致且充满想象的展览中。西安是中国许多最为先进的创新技术的发源地，相信“电子遗留物”项目会与这座城市产生特殊的共鸣。",

    "description_en": "\"Windows Operating Systems have evolved year by year but how should we look at the process in a historical way? Is it really humans designing their various features or is it in fact an evolutionary story of how Windows programs train us to better use them?\" aaajiao\n\nTo celebrate Manchester's position as European City of Science 2016, Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA) presents the first UK solo exhibition by Shanghai based new-media artist, aaajiao.\n\nBorn in 1984, aaajiao's artistic practice is marked by a strong dystopian awareness—he sees no coincidence in the fact that his birth year corresponds with that of George Orwell's classic allegorical novel. aaajiao's work considers our relationships to digital technologies in new ways, dealing with controversies and phenomena around the Internet, as well as the processing of data, the blog-sphere and China's Great Firewall.\n\naaajiao's previous projects have extended his practice into a wide variety of disciplines including architecture, electronic music, performance and product design to capture the pulse of a young generation consuming cyber technology and living through social media.\n\nFor this exhibition, aaajiao turned the Windows 1984 beta version and the Windows 2000 Operating System into a \"digital graveyard\" within an immersive sculptural installation. Among the 25 plastic panels, he utilises contemporary technology to reproduce the first font for Chinese characters ever made in a computer operating system. This artistic process evaluates what happens to out-of-date versions of software as technology moves forward.\n\nTake for example Tennis for none, an installation that turns the earliest video game into a video projection. The original 'Tennis for Two', created in 1958, used a vacuum tube analog computer, most of which were destroyed during the 1960s. The game was fairly simple: two players would each control a knob and attempt to bounce a ball (displayed as a dot) over a net. aaajiao has reimagined both players as machines. An endless loop plays of a ball bouncing into infinity, a game that involves no one.\n\nAnother work, Email Trek, derived from the concept of Star Trek, investigates how connections between people would be lost if the entire email system was abandoned or ceased to exist. This work almost serves as a prophecy. Using a US census as its basis to create a random email address generator, Email Trek then sends each recipient a test email. If the email address is invalid, the computer notes it down. The connecting clear sheet in the installation shows thousands of email addresses - the ones in grey are invalid and the ones in black bolded font are active. It's like we are embarking on a journey in the Star Trek universe, searching out life in the unknown. In the future will a valid email address be the only evidence of life?\n\nThe work typeface is equally interesting. In a similar way to facial recognition technologies, if you present a computer with a number of different written versions of a single Chinese character, then the computer can eventually learn to write it on its own. Like human handwriting, the computer can learn to write it in an infinite number of ways. aaajiao has taught the program 9 different characters which have then been reproduced on the wallpaper. All uniquely different, the computer has seemingly mastered these 9 words. The installation is attached to a USB port where you can download the computer program to also write these 9 characters with your own USB. However, a computer may be able to write these 9 characters, but as aaajiao reminds us it is humans who imbue words with meaning, not the other way around.\n\nThe work Space allows us to reflect on our concept of websites. He has imagined a condition where websites exist, but completely unknown to us. We can't search for them no matter how hard we try and we can't obtain their URLs. A ghostly manifestation of something mundane which we have become accustomed to using in our everyday lives.\n\nIn an era characterised by the importance of keeping up to date with the newest version of technologies, aaajiao presents these thoughtful and whimsical works to remind us of the speed with which we are accustomed to discarding the old for the sake of something new. His projects serve to re-think the capacity and direction of technology in relation to ourselves as an attempt to picture the future.",

This work appropriates that familiar hardware, “impaling” a squab model on the prongs. In Sinitic cuisines, squab is a prized staple—especially in Cantonese and Hong Kong dishes—valued as high-protein and low-fat. For migrants, like many foods of home, it binds language and community, conjuring a sense of “home” that softens loneliness and estrangement. Yet when squab-as-food meets the wider emblem of the pigeon as purity and peace, the rifts and biases around cultural identity come into view.",

The algorithm cannot recover precise physiognomy; the result is a form that feels arbitrary yet legible, a shape of “loneliness.”",

    "description_en": "chi K11 Art Space is pleased to present The Screen Generation, solo exhibition of artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) and also the finale exhibition of 2013 at the space. As one of the young generation artists sponsored by K11 Art Foundation, aaajiao is a leading new media artist in China. His work features exploration and application of data in various forms, endeavoring to present a full picture of his practice and his thought behind it through the modulation/demodulation of data and reality. Known for his ingenious and innovative experiment in integrating computer software with art, in this upcoming solo exhibition, aaajiao will be presenting six of his latest works. Different from the artist’s previous solo exhibitions which showcased logical enquiries and research on data itself, The Screen Generation will share with the audience a more personal experience. The exhibition will open to public on December 14, 2013 and run through February 15, 2014. In the meantime, a series of public education events and seminars will be held during the exhibition at both chi K11 Art Space and Minsheng Art Museum.\n\nAccording to the artist, as a generation who have long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. The screen in the broader sense is non-flat, mobile, movable, constituting a complete ecosystem. Screens are ubiquitous within our culture, allowing us to be interconnected as a whole. The previous definition of screen as “electrical appliance for the display of images and colors” has long been obsolete. As digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself.\n\nThe six pieces that make up The Screen Generation are Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static, and Noise, which all exist and begin as digital applications developed by the artist. The screen might then be understood as a somewhat arbitrary container and frame for the visible and audible components of these applications. But by suggesting that the results of these applications exist less in the various images and sounds produced by them and more in the reception of these components by the audience, it can be said that the screens play an important role in the work of the pieces, and - taking this further - that these works are then human-oriented.\n\nDifferent from aaajiao’s previous works, the six new pieces all cast light on the self-display of technology – technology using itself to represent itself. The “self-display” in the works found here is not such a one-way operation – from machine, outwards, without regard to the presence or absence of a receiver. Here this operation exists as interactions with the human senses and understanding. Ultimately the works exist not in themselves, but in these interactions with a human that takes in the sensory information provided by the work and makes something of it. This “something” is not just an expanded understanding of the work, it is that expanded understanding.\n\nThe display medium used in The Screen Generation is flat screen. In some of the works, these screens appear to display various aspects of themselves. In the other cases they work with the cultural understanding of technology and present certain commentaries on it through their own ability to represent.\n\nIn asking “What is ‘human’ in relation to aaajiao’s works?” a fundamental aspect of his work is then seen to be these screens. It might be interesting to think that the human is in some way constituted by the information that the screen projects out, which then meets the human, the audience, half way. The human is the other to the screen, as the screen is to the human. aaajiao is the creator of an ecosystem between the human and the screen, one that constitutes each from the other.\n\nThe Screen Generation is made possible with the collaboration of Liu Xiaoguang (media artist), Zhang Tao (designer/artist), Tan Shuoxin (sound artist) and Xu Cong (media artist).",
    "description_cn": "chi K11艺术空间荣幸地带来本年度的压轴展览，艺术家aaajiao（徐文恺）个展《屏幕一代》。作为K11 Art Foundation 大力扶持的中国前沿的媒体艺术家，aaajiao的作品专注于对数据的挖掘与实用，并试图以多种形式将其呈现，以此在数据与现实的“调制解调”之中完成对作品内涵的完整表达。他在电脑软件的艺术应用方面，扮演了国内外最新趋势的交流者与先行者角色。本次展览将呈现aaajiao的6件新作，区别于艺术家之前的两次关于对数据本身理性研究的个展，这一次的呈现将会是一次柔软的体验。展览将于2013年12月14日开幕，展至2014年2月15日，期间将会在chi K11艺术空间以及民生现代美术馆举办一系列公共教育活动与讨论会。\n\n《屏幕一代》讨论了早已被信息化的“我们”使用屏幕并成为屏幕本身，彼此构成生态系统的现状。艺术家认为，作为早已被信息化的一代，我们逐渐变成信息的节点。广义的屏幕是非平的、流动的、可移动的并已构成完整生态系统，它们无处不在，相互依靠，已然打破“用于显示图像及色彩的电器”的定义界限。而作为使用者的“我们”，则成为屏幕一代，亦即是屏幕本身。\n\n《屏幕一代》中的六件作品是“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”，它们都存在和源自艺术家开发的电子应用程序。在作品中，屏幕也许会被理解成为这些应用程序的视听组件而存在的、相对来说随意的容器和框架，但另一方面，由于这些程序的结果存在于这些组件被观看者的接受多于它们所制造的图像和声音之中，屏幕因而在这些作品中扮演者重要角色，而基于此出发更深入地看，这些作品又是以人为中心。\n\n与aaajiao以往作品不同的是，这6件新作在体现出科技自我利用，在自身存在中呈现自己特点的时候，不再是从机器向外的，不管观看者在场与否的、单方向的操作，而是强调与人类感官和理解的互相作用。基于上述观点，这些作品并不存在于它们自身之中，而在一个人接收作品所传达的感觉信息和在他从中理解到一些东西之间的互动之中。这些“东西”并不只是一种对作品的深入认识，而是深入的认知本身。\n\n因此，当我们提出：“人与aaajiao的作品之间的关系是什么？”的时候，这些屏幕就会变成他的作品其中一个基本的元素。我们可以假设人在某一个程度上是由屏幕投射的信息所构成，它在半途中与人，与观众遭遇。人是屏幕的另一面，就像屏幕也是人的另一面。aaajiao 创造了一个在人和屏幕之间，彼此互相构成的生态系统。",

    "description_en": "@ 9m² -Museum can be seen as a summary of the aesthetic exploration made by the Screen Generation Series. Compared with the previous two presentations, The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum addresses the interactive relation between man and screen in a more direct and clearer way. In the Screen Generation Series, the artist raises two propositions. The first is to transform application-generated data into images and sounds on screen and to give people sensual and emotional experience through constant presentation. The other is that as a generation having long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. In other words, as digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself. Aaajiao’s work aptly evades concepts such as “personification” and “objectification” that would easily cause confusion and misunderstanding of new media art. In this piece, a complex issue as the interplay between man and screen, or say between man and technology, is skillfully encapsulated in something as subtle as a piece of jewelry. The wearing of these jewelry pieces epitomizes a connection between man and screen. By combining visual images (which are cool and rational as always), sense of taste (of the sugar crystals), psychological hint (given by the action of licking and fondling), and compulsion (on both physical and mental levels), Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum manages to cast light on equality, co-existence and co-development of the relation between screen and man in a humorous way.\n\nOrganizer Goethe Open Space, Department for Culture and Education of the General consulate of the Federal Republic of Germany in Shanghai",
    "description_cn": "@9平米美术馆》是《屏幕一代》系列作品在美学探索上的一次小结。与前两次的展览比较而言，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的相互关系阐述得更加情绪明确。在《屏幕一代》系列作品中，艺术家最初为观众提出了两个命题，一是应用程序生成数据，转换成屏幕上的图像和声音，通过不断的自我展示，带给人类感官与情感的体验。另外一个命题讨论早已被信息化的“我们”逐渐变成信息的节点，使用屏幕的同时也成为屏幕本身，从而与屏幕彼此构成生态系统的现状。本次作品避开了新媒体艺术中容易让人产生理解偏差的“拟人”和“拟物”的观点，将屏幕与人，即科技与人类相互关系的大命题巧妙地落在一件细微之物——首饰上。一贯冷静理性的视觉形象，结晶糖块的味觉体验，吮咬糖块和反复拨弄磁球的心理暗示，心理暗示造成的强迫性的精神反应与行为结果，通过首饰与人肌肤相亲这一个简单的联结，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的平等、共生和共同发展的社会关系举重若轻地地铺展开来。",

    "description_en": "First discovered in the Mediterranean in 1883, the Turritopsis Nutricula is a hydrozoan, whose Medusa (jellyfish) is effectively immortal. When threatened, the Medusa’s cells can age backwards from sexual maturity to those halcyon days of jellyfish childhood. From there, they age again, then regress again, ad infinitum. This happens through a process called transdifferentiation, in which one type of cell switches to another type. For this piece, aaajiao created an algorithmically generated swarm of these creatures. As the pixelated bloom floats by, one thinks about how the digital age confounds the linear march of time. The two poles of Turritopis‘s existence–youth and sexual maturity–find parallel in our division between the virtual world and the physical.",

    "description_en": "Three strands are braided into a single cut: Sun Santo’s sacred tune Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ritual performance of Ksitigarbha inherited from his grandmother; and everyday clips Gongze posted to his friend circle. The narrative takes its cue from Gongze’s account of peers in Harbin: drifting through club culture, turning to livestream commerce, then—amid economic shifts—entering the “chuma xian” spirit-medium system to “see/soothe,” a role akin to informal counseling. Ag threads these with a framework of Ksitigarbha devotion and an urban sensorium of “ruin—bardo.”\n\nThe trajectory mirrors phases of the Simplified-Chinese internet and public discourse, charting the currents of “folk spirituality—platform economy—generational livelihood,” and placing the consolatory function of Crying Smoke-Soul in counterpoint to a social role likened to a “psychiatrist.” Ag’s method draws on a Jiangnan rite for Ksitigarbha—“inserting stick incense” into the earth—both a family lineage and a way to intervene on site. In 2016, Ag enacted it at the former “Qijia Village” in Putuo. Shanghai, in Ag’s grasp, is a “bardo/illusory city”: center and fold, underground and edge, gleam and height as a single continuum, where roles and scenes turn on the axis “ruin—bardo—vow-power.”\n\nThe “temporary ruins” left by the Dinghai Bridge relocation anchor the shoot and interlock with an incense rite on Ksitigarbha’s birthday, proposing a bodily way of seeing that “finds soil’s seams in concrete.” In the post-pandemic city, driverless metros and the “ghost train” rhyme with a “headless, tailless film,” linking to a clear-eyed practice of “seeing better in the dark”—a chain of metaphors that gives the image its “bardo-in-ruins” cadence.\n\nThe finished edit lays its sound bed with Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ruin-body performance steers the image; and friend-circle clips puncture the surface as reality’s burrs. Folk belief, urban experience, and platformed life are made concurrent, elaborating a viewing mode and narrative in which “vow-power moves through the bardo.”",
    "description_cn": "这件作品由三部分素材拼合而成：使用孙三通的神调《哭烟魂》、Ag祖传自奶奶的地藏仪轨行为视频- Ksitigarbha，以及宫泽发布于朋友圈的生活片段，最终被重新剪辑成单一的视频。其叙事线索来自宫泽讲述的东北（哈尔滨）同辈从俱乐部文化到直播带货再到转入“出马仙”式的“心理咨询/安抚”角色的转变，并由Ag以地藏信仰与“废墟—中阴（bardo）”的城市感受为精神框架将三者串联。\n\n作品的叙事线索来自宫泽对东北（哈尔滨）同辈的一段代际轨迹的讲述：从少年混迹俱乐部、进入club工作，转向直播带货，再在经济转折后进入“出马仙”体系，以“看事/安抚”的方式承担某种“心理咨询”角色。这一路径与简中互联网及社会舆论的阶段性变迁同频，呈现“民间灵性—平台经济—代际生计”的流变，并在语义上将“心理医生式”的社会角色与《哭烟魂》的劝解功能对位。\n\nAg的行动框架来自江南关于地藏的民间供养仪轨“插棒香（插地香）”——既是家族传承，也是其介入城市现场的方法论。2016年，Ag曾在普陀“七家村”旧址公开完成相关仪式。Ag对上海的整体感知是“中阴（bardo）/幻觉之城”：将中心的褶皱、地下与边缘与高耸光鲜视为同一连续体，并以“废墟—中阴—愿力”的转换逻辑来塑造角色与场景。\n\n定海桥动迁后的“暂时性废墟”成为拍摄起点，并与地藏诞辰日完成的插香仪轨相互嵌合，指向一种“在混凝土中寻找泥土缝隙”的身体化观看方式。后疫情时期的无人驾驶地铁与“幽灵列车”意象呼应“无头无尾的电影”，与“在黑暗中看得更清”的清眼动作构成隐喻链条，支撑“中阴在废墟中”的影像语感。",

    "description_en": "LEO XU PROJECTS is proud to present “alias: aaajiao” the first solo exhibition of widely exhibited young Chinese media artist Xu Wenkai, who is based in Shanghai working under the vague internet alias of aaajiao. The exhibition comprises a body of new and commissioned works, which measure the new dimension of high technology and media-based works, and address the issues derived from contemporary living with Internet and digital technology. The exhibition runs from January 16th through March 8th, 2015, with a series of events and presentations to take place on and off line. The artist will be present at the opening reception on Friday January 16th, 5-7pm.\n\nAs the title suggests, “alias: aaajiao” highlights an intense sci-fi aspect of aaajiao’s recent projects that re-imagines the capacity and direction of technology and pictures the future of human living and physical transformation through evolving notion of time and space, which has been subjects of films and many other pop culture products in the past two years. The centrepiece of the show “Karesansui” (2015) is a site-specific sculpture that borrows its title from Japanese Dry Landscape also known as the Rock Garden. Created by his algorithm and made of sponges that look as firm as rock, aaajiao’s “Karesansui” presents an unsettling dystopian scenery of numerous pitch-black mutant limbs that grow out of the gallery’s floors, walls, and stairway, sprawling all over and competing with each other. Another set of sculptures “Anomaly” (2015)—produced in technique and material identical to “Karesansui” but in the shape of meteors—celebrates the classic beauty of dark imagination of bio and physical mutation that has been frequent to the sci-fi cinema and visual representation.\n\nHaving collaborated with a team of media artist, designer, programmer and engineer, aaajiao has been testing the complexity of digitised still-life and landscape works. “Obj. 3” and “Obj. 4” (made in 2014), two video portraits of stones on miniature screens, introduced a new dimension of time and space to a classic and painterly composition. “Limited Landscape, Unlimited” is an on-going series that explores the geologic evolution, by visualising the ever-changing landscape through his algorithmic study and digital rendering. The project includes a video showcasing infinite possibilities of geologic formation, a set of photographs of pixelized land, and a maglev installation featuring a sculpture prototype spinning in the air.\n\nOn the third floor of gallery will be a commissioned new project, in which aaajiao has invented his own methodology to investigate the invisible physical operation of meridian system (in Chinese herbal medicine and philosophy). He incorporates the contemporary Fractal Theory and computer algorithm in his research to trace the energy channels and points within human body, transplanting this internal micro universe into tattoo patterns and gallery space. A variation of the presentation will also be on view in gallery’s booth in forthcoming Frieze Art Fair New York.\n\nActively online as a media artist, blogger, activist and programmer, aaajiao is the virtual persona of Shanghai-based artist Xu Wenkai, whose offline practices include a celebrated entrepreneur of co-working projects XINDANWEI—that tested a new way of living and working nomad in cosmopolitan Shanghai—and an inspiring teacher of New Media art. Born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities Xi’an, aaajiao’s art and works are marked by a strong dystopian awareness—his year of birth being the synonym of Orwell’s classic allegory novel—and literati spirits and sophistication. Many of aaajiao’s works speak to new thinking, controversies and phenomenon around Internet, with specific projects focusing on the processing of Data, the blogsphere and China’s Great Fire Wall. Aaajiao’s recent projects extend his practice to various disciplines (architecture, electronic music, performance, product design, medicine, among many others) to take the pulse of a young generation consuming and living in cyber technology and social media.\n\nAaajiao’s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world, for instance, “Thingworld, International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing”, The National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2014); “Pandamounium”, Media Art from Shanghai, Momentum, Berlin (2014); The West Bund Architecture and Contemporary Art Biennale, Shanghai (2013);”One World” Exposition – Chinese Art in the Age of the New Media, Videotage, Hong Kong (2011); Transmediale, Berlin (2010), etc. He received the Jury Prize from Art Sanya Awards 2014 and was nominated for the first edition of OCAT – Pierre Huber Art Prize in 2014.\n\nAaajiao’s works are also on view concurrently in two museums in Shanghai: “Cosmos—Limited and Limitless, Existence and Co-existence”, 21st Century Minsheng Art Museum, Shanghai and “The Truth About Entropy”, OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal Shanghai, Shanghai.\n\nFor further information on the artist and works, please contact the gallery atinfo@leoxuprojects.com or phone +86-21-34611245.",
    "description_cn": "LEO XU PROJECTS很荣幸地展出《代号：aaajiao》。本次展览是活跃于国际的中国年轻新媒体艺术家aaajiao在2015年的首次画廊个展。展览将集中呈现以aaajiao作为其网络别名和创作艺名的上海艺术家徐文恺新作以及为展览委约创作的项目。这批作品丈量了以新科技、新媒体为依托的艺术创作的新维度和方向，并探索了以互联网和数码技术为主导当代生活中急迫的议题。展览将从2015年1月16日展出至3月8日。展览同期将有一系列在线和线下的活动和展出。艺术家本人亦将会出席开幕酒会，时间：周五，1月16日，晚5至7时。\n\n如近年影视以及流行文化作品中对“科幻”题材的热衷和泛化，《代号：aaajiao》亦从aaajiao创作中近似“科幻”的特征展开，重新想象当下科技的疆域和方向，并在不断更新的“时空”概念里，描绘人类住居和异变的未来。作品《枯山水》（2015）系为现场度身创作的雕塑。顾名思义，标题取自日本园林设计中的“枯山水”。这批由电脑算法生成的黑色海绵雕塑，触觉柔软却看似坚硬如磐石。它们形如异变的肢体，生长在展厅地面、墙面和楼梯，波浪状地推散、蔓延开去。而同类作品《不规则》（2015）则以比陨石更诡异的形态将科幻作品中对异形的美、黑暗的美的想象物化、移植进了日常空间。\n\nAaajiao近期在与其包含了新媒体艺术家、设计师、程序员和工程师的跨领域团队协作中，创作了一批数字化的静物和风景作品。不同于传统意义中的静物、风景绘画，aaajiao单纯凭借电脑算法生成、数码渲染的影像作品为这些传统的艺术形式注入了新一层的时间、空间维度。如完成于2014年的《物 3》和《物 4》均在时间线索上绘制了难以再现的关于矿物岩石生成的静物作品。而《有限的无限风景》（2014-2015）则将计算机算法视觉化成了一副不断形变中的地貌图景，展示了漫长时间轴上传统艺术表现形式无法捕捉或想象的地貌无穷变化。这一系列包含了录像短片、出自电脑渲染的像素化的风景摄影，以及由磁悬浮技术完成的漂浮于半空的地貌雕塑。\n\n在本次展览的三楼展厅，艺术家将展出委约创作的最新系列。这批作品中aaajiao研发了自身独特的工作方式和视觉语言，探索中医理论中的经络原理。他将现代分形理论、计算机算法贯穿至他对中医的经络研究中，将人体内无形的场域外化进展览现场，甚至转译成为文身图案。该项目的另一个版本将在五月纽约的弗里兹艺术博览会的画廊展位中展出。\n\nAaajiao是徐文恺的网络化名，aaajiao代表了他新媒体艺术家、博客、网络活动家等诸多身份。而其线下的工作亦包括了上海联合办公项目“新单位”的创始人——这个项目讨论了在国际都市上海个体游牧式的工作生活的可能性——以及新媒体艺术家的教师等。Aaajiao于1984年生于西安，就像这个年份——1984年也是奥威尔同名小说的标题——和地点所象征的巧合，他的作品充满了强烈的科技的想象以及文人情怀。不少aaajiao的作品都切中了今天互联网相关的新思维、议题以及现象，其中不少项目都探索了数据处理、博客领域以及中国的防火墙等问题。Aaajiao近期的创作中的跨领域协作（建筑、电子音乐、表演、产品设计、医学等）都无疑都聚焦于今天消费网络技术、生活于社交媒体中的青年一代。\n\nAaajiao的作品频繁展出于国内外的诸多展览，其中包括《齐物等观——国际新媒体艺术三年展》，中国美术馆，北京（2014）；《PANDAMONIUM 又一次发声 ——来自上海的媒体艺术》，Momentum，柏林（2014）；《西岸建筑与当代艺术双年展》，上海（2013）；《平行世界》，录映太奇，香港（2011）；《转译媒体节》，柏林（2010），等等。2014年底，他不仅荣获第三届三亚艺术季暨华宇青年家评审大奖，亦入围首届OCAT皮埃尔•于贝尔奖。",

Reflecting on this intersection, local and global networks, social media, gardening structures, parks, and nature all become amalgamated into a digital hyper-representation. The work borrows aesthetics from existing role-playing action games such as Mother3 and Undertale, reflecting a world that is at once familiar yet slightly dystopian. In this digital space, the boundaries between the physical and the virtual blur, leading viewers to question the nature of memory in the age of machine learning.\n\nThe evolution of memory from its historical roots to its modern-day incarnation is central to bot, Matteo Ricci, a Jesuit priest, introduced the concept of the \"memory palace\" to the Chinese literati in the late 16th century. His method involved associating ideas with images and spatially arranging these images to aid memory retention. Over time, our understanding of memory has shifted away from these spatial techniques. Today, we emphasize logical and psychological associations, focusing less on preventing images in the mind from fading and more on the inner world of the mind and the emotions tied to our memories. This shift reflects a broader change in how we engage with memory, moving from a reliance on spatial memory to an exploration of the mind's inner workings.\n\nIn bot, aaajiao builds on this historical context by exploring the implications of machine learning on memory. The artist, known for his deep engagement with code, software backend structures, and online platforms, questions what happens to memory and attention as machines increasingly read and even become our minds. As aaajiao declares, “now that we have become bots, we are just one with the mind of the hive.” This statement underscores the idea that our individual cognitive processes are becoming integrated into a collective digital consciousness, blurring the lines between human and machine-driven memory.\n\nThe video is not merely a passive reflection but also an active demonstration of how a neural network—through iterative fine-tuning—can reshape our memories into new narratives. Using interdependent images and videos from our extended online lives, along with found sounds, bot, constructs a portrait of memory based on a machine's interpretation. This raises critical questions about the future of memory and the potential for new, creative subjectivities born from this digital process. As we navigate this new landscape, we are challenged to consider the implications of ceding control of our memories to machines and the potential loss of the human-centric model of memory in favor of an algorithmic one.\n\nThe work also subtly critiques the simulation of memory by machines. While a machine can mimic the analogical process at the heart of human memory, bot, reveals the limitations and potential dangers of this approach. As aaajiao shows us, we are only beginning to understand the implications of these advancements in machine learning. The future may hold bots with agency, narrative sense, and even autobiographical impulses, blurring the lines between human memory and machine-driven processing.\n\nIn bot, aaajiao offers a landscape of memory that is both captivating and unsettling. The work prompts us to reflect on our cognitive abilities, the role of attention in memory, and the influence of big data on our minds. As we move towards a future where memory is increasingly shaped by digital processes, aaajiao encourages us to remain mindful of our freedoms and the new cultural values that may emerge from this transformation. bot, is a powerful reminder of how far we've come in our understanding of memory and a cautionary exploration of the new world that lies ahead.\n\nhttps://earth.google.com/web/@-19.97606078,-68.18875629,3837.81524553a,2599.63737003d,30y,114.56918558h,60t,0r/data=KAI\n\nhttps://earth.google.com/static/9.0.33.1/app_min.html#@21.431661,88.57237,-15a,28990d,30y,270h,30t,0r/data=KAI\n\nhttps://earth.google.com/static/9.0.35.2/app_min.html#@25.854898,58.566828,376a,7006d,30y,270h,30t,0r/data=KAI\n\nhttps://earth.google.com/static/9.0.36.2/app_min.html#@21.811156,-14.790823,212a,3614d,30y,270h,30t,0r/data=KAI",

    "description_en": "Aaajiao is the virtual persona of Xu Wenkai, media artist, blogger, activist and programmer. The Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist presents his first solo gallery exhibition in Europe, at House of Egorn, with a video piece and a series of sculptural works especially created for the occasion. In addition, a range of his iconic works will be shown at ArtBerlin fair concurrently.\n\nThe large-scale installation ‘bots,’ at House of Egorn is a reflection on the general consumption of molecules, particles and other minutiae in the artist’s private and public life, blown up to surreal dimensions. Based on journeys across the city, aaajiao’s video ‘bot,’ displays an environment deeply intertwined with a digital past as well as its present counterpart. Local and global networks, social media, gardening structures, parks, and nature itself all become amalgamated into a digital hyper-representation.\n\nAaajiao’s work tackles game culture and social media platforms, sampled from his own account of China’s most popular social media platform, wechat. Recordings made with his own phone are combined with references to open online media sources. Bots, (the title of his new work) is a video game published by Acclaim Games Incorporated in 2006, which includes a function to submit video games created by members. In this multi-player online fighting game, players choose from one of three basic avatars and upgrade their characters entering multi-player story modes. Combined with the artist’s social media surrounding and mobile recordings of his way from and to his studio in Shanghai, the viewer enters a digital zone which looks more familiar than we are ready to admit, and where the personal view is directed through the mobile phone. What is real, in societies which are increasingly perceived through the membranes of digital tools? Which protagonists are real to us? Who is using which platforms in order to win what kind of game? How does this affect the art scene? With Bots, aaajiao questions the way „users“ loose control of reality as participants of a total environmental digitalisation.\n\nWhile public and private media in China are being increasingly observed and restricted, in his work aaajiao frequently uses Chinese social media platforms to show, on a local level, how users from his personal daily sphere behave on these platforms. Rather than focusing on political issues in his home country, he brings his discomfort about the usage of media into an international discourse, mixing references from the world wide web within and outside of the firewall. The video is uploaded into open source and directly streamed from the Internet at House of Egorn.\n\nThe video work is shown alongside a large scale installation made with nine unique inflatable objects. The shapes of the objects appear as the abstracts of molecules. They are magnified to take up the entirety of the gallery space, surreal versions of single biological elements serving as identity-carriers of life forms. For the exhibition, aaajiao has also created a role play on his personal lap top screen in which he shows his own reception of his environment. The visitor is treated as the voyeur who gets limited access to the artist's view. The message is a dystopian critic on a development the artist has been observing since his childhood, when constantly he would not join in the playing, but watch other people play games.\n\nAn introductory text to the exhibition has been written by Defne Ayas, museum executive, curator and publisher working with contemporary art, media, and politics. Ayas has worked at and with many institutions across the world, including in the Netherlands, China, United States, Italy, and Russia. Most recently, she was the director of the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam (2012-2017)\n\nActive online as a media artist, blogger, activist and programmer, aaajiao is the virtual persona of Xu Wenkai. The artist lives and works in Shanghai and Berlin. Born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities, Xi’an, aaajiao’s art and works are marked by a strong dystopian Orwellian awareness and modern, urban literati spirits. Many of his works speak to new thinkings, controversies and phenomenon around the Internet, with specific projects focusing on the processing of data, the blogsphere and China’s Great Fire Wall. His most recent projects have extended his practice to wider disciplines - including architecture, topography, and design - capturing the reality of the younger generations inhabiting a parallel reality on social media.\n\naaajiao’s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world, upcoming and recent shows include “Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today”, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, Boston (2018); “unREAL”, Haus der elektronischen Künste, Basel (2017); “Shanghai Project Part II”, Shanghai (2017); “Temporal Turn: Art and Speculation in Contemporary Asia”,\n\nSpencer Museum of Art, Kansas (2016); “Take Me (I’m Yours)” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jens Hoffmann and Kelly Taxter), Jewish Museum, New York (2016); “Overpop”, Yuz Museum,\n\nShanghai (2016); “Hack Space” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Amira Gad), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space, Hong Kong and chi K11 art museum, Shanghai (2016); “Globale:\n\nGlobal Control and Censorship”, ZKM | Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (2015); “Thingworld International Triennial of New Media Art”, The National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2014);\n\nCentre for Chinese Contemporary Art, Manchester (2016); OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal Xi’an, Xi’an (2016), among others. He was awarded the Art Sanya Awards in 2014 Jury Prize and was nominated for the first edition of OCAT-Pierre Huber Art Prize in 2014.",

It is not difficult to figure that “ddrk” is not the pinyin initials of \"Low-End Film and TV\", but of \"Low-End Population\" (dī duān rén kǒu). On the About page of the website, the webmaster writes that “Our goal is to provide the most convenient online viewing experience for both computers and mobile devices with ultra-clear picture quality. The domain name ddrk.me is self-deprecating and does not refer to you as a visitor to the site, so please do not take it personally.\" I habitually checked the domain name's whois information, recorded it, later printed it on industrial films, and included them in the space. These films easily generate static electricity, stick to the skin, the floor and walls, and absorb dust.",

The jellyfish reproduces itself asexually and its cells split continuously, from infancy to adulthood, and adulthood back to infancy. It is evidence of immortality found in nature. aaajiao transfers the jellyfish from the living into the digital form, as the examination and reflection on this phenomenon.\n\nTurritopsis nutricula, the potentially immortal jellyfish, is a hydrozoan whose medusa, or jellyfish, form can revert to the polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. It is the only known case of a metazoan capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary stage.[2][3] It does this through the cell development process of transdifferentiation. Cell transdifferentiation is when the jellyfish \"alters the differentiated state of the cell and transforms it into a new cell.\" In this process the medusa of the immortal jellyfish is transformed into the polyps of a new polyp colony. First, the umbrella reverts itself and then the tentacles and mesoglea get resorbed. The reverted medusa then attaches itself to the substrate by the end that had been at the opposite end of the umbrella and starts giving rise to new polyps to form the new colony. Theoretically, this process can go on infinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,[3][4] although in nature, most Turritopsis, like other medusae, are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the plankton stage, without reverting to the polyp form.[5] No single specimen has been observed for any extended period, so it is not currently possible to estimate the age of an individual, and so even if this species has the potential for immortality, there is no laboratory evidence of many generations surviving from any individual..(.",

    "description_en": "Memory Vending Machines (2009) is an “invention” proposed by the artist based on the predicted scientific advancement (nano, biotech). The appearance and basic functions of this installation are similar to that of Capsule Vending Machine. This kind of easy-to-use self-service vending machines can be found in convenience shops across the entire city. Different from general Capsule Vending Machines, this Memory Vending Machine sells capsules, which, based on the conception by the artist, seem empty inside but have actually encapsulated numerous tiny nano-robots. Inhaled by the user of the air inside the capsule, these nano-robots carrying special data will enter and colonize the human brains, and propagate themselves to form memory zones. In addition, different individuals can communicate with each other, which actually means people can enter each other’s memories and fully read sensory information including vision, hearing, feeling, tasting, olfaction, etc., and acquire the whole “real” experience (revivification) on its own organic body. Descriptive animation is played on the electronic screen of the installation, elaborating the visitors on the principles and purposes of this “invention”.",

    "size": "",
    "duration": "",
    "description_en": "which was exhibited many times in Beijing and Shanghai. As exhibitions went on, aaajiao developed the scope of The Screen Generation from installations to performances and from vision to touch. The jewelry exhibited here are conceptual extension based on the 6 video installations, namely Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise, of that project.\n\nThe Screen Generation aims to explore the relationship between man and information. In his view, aaajiao believes that the existence of mankind is highly informationized and has formed an ecological system together with the Screen. We are the Screen Generation and have become the screen itself. The 6 pieces titled Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise respectively represent certain human character and emotion. Through reading each other we have built an equal relationship of communication.\n\nThe 6 pieces of jewelry with the same titles as the installations are results of collaboration between media artist aaajiao and jewelry designer Shen Lei. When the jewelry is placed on the table, they become an independent jewelry installation. The models of the jewelry come from Meta, an algorithm performance of The Screen Generation. But the artists abandoned previous visual logics; instead they resorted to pure touch experience. For example, in addition to 3D-printed resin, the eardrops titled Hard have sugar paste coating on part of the material. The sugar coating can be sucked on to create unique shapes; The ring titled Repeatedly is made of permanent magnet which compels one to play with it repeatedly as if he suffers from OCD; The Noise fights one’s palm with spikes to finally reach equality between man and information.\n\nThe artists subverted the stereotype of jewelry which is “precious metal to decorate human body”. They not only have trendy looks, but also try to interact with human body and have dialogues at every unintentional touch.\n\nThe Soft is a piece of cloth with an intimate sense of waviness. But when you touch it, you will be surprised at its hardness which you may find in concrete. This ambiguous feeling is a representation of entangled relationship between man and information. In the exhibition the Soft is a blue screen, across which abstract shadows slowly move. Looking at this screen, you will be confused. Are these shadows your own or from a virtual world? Are you within or outside the boundary? Embedded in the Internet structure created by man, the information influences us in a subtle rather than abrupt way. It’s given a soft character, just like this grey cloth brooch. You can’t really tell if it’s waving or not, but you can sense the ambiguity.\n\nThe Repeatedly is a ring which is impossible to stay still. Two ordinary iron rings and a magnetic bead could simulate a planetary orbit in the universe, which is eternally immutable repetition. Keeping apart, getting close, turning around and sliding over. This kind of manipulation is in our human nature which is fully understood by jewelry designer Shen Lei who designed this ring to represent the irresistible and inescapable fate. The Repeatedly is also a 40-frame gif file on the screen, which constructs an infinite depth of space by releasing information repeatedly. The essential meaning of repetition is one could devour greater things in the simplest way. Repetition is also cunning, making us anxious and agitated, while repeated movements uncover our subconscious pursuit of pleasure.\n\nThe Hard shows its predominance in the exhibition. While other 5 screens display silent images, the only one exuberating with human voice becomes a focus of attention. In fact, it is just a little trick played by the artist. On the screen, Isaac Asimov is elaborating on The Three Laws of Robotics. But the off-screen voice does not correspond with the subtitle. Instead they obstruct each other. The artist meant to express that the transmission of sound could aggressively interfere with information. To express the aggressiveness, jewelry designer Shen Lei extracted a pointed shape from Meta to make these eardrops. But because of their hardness they are less tough and more fragile. Similarly aggressive sound is parallel to the void. The most brilliant design is that the stone material is coated with sugar paste, which may be sucked on to create unique shapes. Consequently the Hard is melted by our active engagement. The action of sucking also gives the Hard a kind of intimacy unparalleled among other jewelry.\n\nThe Pure is a unit. A red copper cube answers to RGB -- 3 primary colors displayed on the screen. They both are basic units to constitute this world. The Pure has a unique feature of purity because it is a piece of unwearable jewelry, unlike a necklace, eardrops, ring or others. However, it is given more possibility for closer engagement. It can be put in your palm, on your back or near your ear, rising and falling with your breath, travelling around your body. While RGB serves as the basic unit of all dynamic visual information, this little cube of red copper re-interprets the attribute of jewelry as a basic unit of information equal to human beings.\n\nThe Static is the moment when water bursts open. A dynamic moment is frozen to create a great beauty of balance. The designer retained 10 different states of water. When they dance around you in the form of necklace and eardrops, they seem to set off endless ripples. As the saying goes, “One’s mind is as peaceful as still water”. The Static uplifts this concept by showing that water can be not only two-dimensional but three-dimensional to metaphorize peaceful mind. In parallel is the black screen in the exhibition, where rays of dim white light as poetic as the moonlight leak from the rim. As aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) said, “If we are the screen itself, this moment should be static.”\n\nThe Noise is the white noise of television. This ancient noise seems to contain certain strength. It looks dense, boring and dizzy, sounds dissonant and restless, and feels threatening and oppressive. As soon as a globefish is threatened, it will swallow water or air to turn itself into a prickly ball. Inspired by it, Shen Lei designed the Noise, a prickly ball symbolizing defiance and expulsion, as if it is resisting the stagnation of information. When worn on the finger, it will slide into your palm due to gravity. Every touch feels a subtle sting. The more force you apply, the deeper mark it leaves on your skin, which makes it a relentless and misbehaving object. The screen links sound and vision, while the jewelry links vision and touch, which really brings out the theme.",
    "description_cn": "，在北京、上海举办了多次展览。随着展览的一次次深入，aaajiao(徐文恺)将《屏幕一代》的呈现从装置拓展到表演，并从视觉转换到触觉。此次展出的首饰就是基于《屏幕一代》“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”六件视频装置的首饰概念延展。\n\n《屏幕一代》旨在探讨人与信息的关系。在aaajiao(徐文恺)看来，人类的存在已经高度信息化，与屏幕彼此构成生态系统，我们既是屏幕一代，也已经成为屏幕本身。展览中的六件作品“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”分别抽象出人类的某种性格和情绪，人类与屏幕在互相阅读中已经形成了一种平等的沟通关系。\n\n与作品同名的六件首饰由艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)与首饰设计师沈磊合作完成，六件首饰置于桌面，其本身又构成了一件独立的首饰装置。首饰的模型基本上来源于《屏幕一代》中的算法表演Meta。但艺术家摒弃了此前的视觉逻辑，而诉诸于单纯的触觉体验。譬如，“坚硬”的耳坠部分除了3D打印树脂之外特意包裹了部分翻糖晶体，人们可以通过吮食糖来塑造独一无二的形态；永磁体构造的指环“反复”迫使人强迫症般地旋转把玩；而“闹”则凭借浑身的利刺与人的掌心彼此搏斗角力，最终实现人与信息的平衡。\n\n柔软是一块布，具有亲密的抖动感。当你触碰它时，会惊讶于水泥的硬糙质感。这种难以分辨的模糊感觉，是人与信息纠葛不清的写照。柔软在展览中是一块蓝色的屏幕，高度抽象的光影在屏幕中缓慢游移，你站在屏幕前感到困惑，这些影子究竟是你的还是虚拟世界的？你究竟身处界限之内、还是之外？身处我们创造的互联网结构之下，信息对我们的侵蚀并非来势汹汹，而是潜移默化。它们被赋予了“柔软”的性格，正如这块灰色的布料胸针，似抖动非抖动，暧昧不定。\n\n反复是一枚根本停不下来的戒指。两个普通的铁环由一颗小磁珠吸在一起，便可以模拟宇宙行星运转轨迹。那是一种亘古不变的“反复”。远离、靠近、翻转、滑动，设计师沈磊深谙人的天性，迎合了你无法抗拒而逃不掉的宿命感。反复是屏幕中的gif，一幅40帧的gif小图可以通过反复释放信息而构造一块无限深度的空间。反复的要义在于，用最简单的方式吞没更大的东西。反复是狡黠的，而置身反复的人们焦虑、烦躁，不断循环的动作释放出人们潜意识中对快感的追求。\n\n坚硬在展览中体现出强势的一面。当其余五块屏幕静默地展示着无声图像，这唯一一件充满人声的作品成为关注的焦点。事实上，这只是艺术家玩的小小把戏。屏幕上，科学家作家以撒·艾西莫夫阐述着偏激的《机器人三定律》，而画外传递出的声音与底部的字幕并不对应，反而互相阻隔。艺术家想说的是，声音传播对信息的干扰是极为强势的。为了体现这种强势，沈磊从Meta中提取了锐利的形状，制成耳坠。然而硬度高，意味着韧性弱而易碎，正如声音的强势往往与无效并行。石材外部包裹的一层翻糖成为“坚硬”最为出彩的部分，你可以通过吮吸来塑造耳坠独一无二的形态，硬在人的主动参与中融化。而舔这一动作，也赋予了“坚硬”其他首饰难以企及的亲密关系。\n\n纯粹是一个单位。一块立方体紫铜，与屏幕上呈现的RGB三原色彼此呼应，它们都是构成这个世界的基本。“纯粹” 具有独一无二的纯粹性，它是一件无法佩戴的首饰，并非项链、耳坠、戒指或者其它。但这也赋予了它更多参与的可能性。你可以把它置于手心，放在背上，耳边，它会随你的呼吸起伏，在周身游走。如果说RGB三原色构建了这个世界一切动态可视化信息，那这块小小的紫铜，则重新诠释了首饰作为与人平等的信息基本单位的属性。\n\n静止是水炸开的一刻。动态中的一瞬被凝固下来，透着平衡之美。设计师保留了十种水的不同状态，当它们作为项链和耳坠荡漾在周身，仿佛激起了层层涟漪。“静止”更迭了心如止水的概念，它并非只是平面的水，也可以是立体的水，跳脱出烦躁而获得某种平和。正如展览中的静止是一块漆黑的屏幕，几缕泛白的微光从屏幕四周漏下，如同月光般富有诗意。aaajiao(徐文恺)说，“如果我们是屏幕，这一刻应该是静止的”。\n\n闹是电视里的白噪音。古老的聒噪似乎蕴藏着某种力量，视觉上是密集的、枯燥的、晕眩的，而听觉上是嘈杂的、躁郁的，带给人威胁感与压迫感。河豚一旦受到威胁，就会吞下水或空气使身体膨胀成多刺的圆球，沈磊据此设计了“闹”，一个象征反抗和驱逐的多次圆球。“闹”仿佛在抵御信息的滞涩。当你把闹戴在手指上，出于重力它会习惯性地滑到掌心，每次触碰都会带来轻微的刺感，你越使力，“闹”在你的皮肤上便留下更深的印记，毫不留情，绝不安分。屏幕里的“闹”贯穿了声音到视觉，作为首饰的“闹”则连贯了视觉到触觉，成为点题之作。",

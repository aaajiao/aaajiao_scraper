### [Absurd Reality Check](https://eventstructure.com/Absurd-Reality-Check) / 荒诞现实检测

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Rotating LED screen, 10-inch LED screen, digitally printed sewing doll / 旋转LED屏幕，10英寸LED屏幕，数码打印缝纫人偶

**Size**: Variable dimensions

**中文描述**: 该视频装置由一件数码打印的缝制人偶与两块按特定尺寸定制的LED屏幕构成。缝制人偶的形象源于对“精神小伙”（精神小伙”是一个网络流行语，用来形容那些衣着打扮独特（如锅盖头、豆豆鞋、紧身衣裤）、行为风格夸张（如跳“社会摇”）的年轻男性，他们看起来活力充沛，但其形象被认为带有“土嗨”的风格。）进行AI“去面部特征化”后的图像，视频部分分别命名为《两个仪式》和《一个仪式》。

**Description**: This installation combines a digitally printed sewn doll with two custom LED screens. The doll’s image derives from an AI process that removes facial identifiers from the figure of the “jingshen xiaohuo” (a meme for flamboyant young men—pot-lid haircuts, beaded loafers, tight outfits; exaggerated moves like “shehui yao”—whose exuberance carries a “tu-hai,” or kitschy-provincial, charge). The videos are titled Two rituals and One ritual.

### [Guard, I…](https://eventstructure.com/Guard-I) / 保安，我...

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: silicone, fiberglass, artificial hair, clothing, seat

**Size**: 75 x 75 x 140 cm

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/1117816223?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Guard" is a installation artwork created using silicone, 3D printing, and fiberglass, depicting the figure of a security guard bearing the artist's own face. The inspiration for this piece comes from the unique role and circumstances of security guards in Chinese society during the COVID-19 lockdowns. During this period, security guards—typically individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, veterans, or increasingly unemployed college graduates—were suddenly granted temporary authority by local governments. Empowered overnight, these guards rapidly transformed from community caretakers into authoritarian enforcers, imposing harsh and sometimes brutal measures upon the very residents they once served, resulting in numerous tragedies.

The artist compares this months-long, severe lockdown to a "Stanford Prison Experiment" involving billions of people, using the artwork to explore the moral dilemmas and struggles of individuals under extreme authoritarian conditions. By placing his own face onto the security guard figure, the artist reflects upon his own potential complicity: if placed in an increasingly extreme environment, would he also be forced to don the guard's uniform, feign sleep, avoid confronting reality, or even become an executor of oppressive power?

Through "Guard," the artist seeks to provoke contemplation on the human predicament under authoritarian rule, while also critically examining his own position as someone who has left Shanghai, now lives in Berlin, and holds the privilege of narrating the pains and traumas of this era.

### [Guard, I…](https://eventstructure.com/Guard-I-Long-hair) / 保安，我...

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Silicone, resin 3D printing, artificial hair, clothing, seat / 硅胶，树脂3D打印，人造毛发，服装，座椅

**Size**: 75 x 75 x 140 cm

**中文描述**: 以艺术家自身的面部与身体形态为蓝本，通过拍照结合 AI 算法生成粗模，再以传统工艺完成的一尊硅胶人偶。人偶身着常见的保安制服，坐在椅子上，仿佛在打盹。在中国，保安曾经多由退伍军人或从乡村进城务工、年龄稍长的人担任。近几年，尤其是新冠疫情之后，保安也成了不少失业年轻人的选择，与保洁、保姆一起被戏称为“吉祥三宝”。简中互联网中还流行“年轻人当保安，少走四十年弯路”的迷因。瘟疫封城期间，居民大多被限制在居所与小区内，保安在行政口头授权下承担起“关键角色”，掌握出入与秩序管理等权限，成为小区层面“最小单位的法西斯”，也是很多被封居民的瘟疫创伤。与此同时，这份工作日常往往枯燥而孤独。许多年轻保安开始经营自媒体，拍 vlog 分享日常，希望借助全民注意力经济改善低收入处境并获得关注。

**Description**: Modeled on the artist’s own face and body, a rough form was generated via photography and AI, then finished by hand into a silicone figure. Dressed in a standard security uniform, the figure sits in a chair, as if drifting into a nap. In China, security work was once largely taken by veterans and older rural migrants. Since the pandemic, it has also become a fallback for unemployed youth—jokingly grouped online with cleaners and nannies as the “Auspicious Three Treasures.” A meme on the Simplified-Chinese internet quips: “Young people becoming security guards, skipping forty years of detours.” During lockdowns, guards—under verbal administrative mandate—managed gates and order within residential compounds, becoming, at the scale of the neighborhood, “the smallest unit of fascism,” and a locus of trauma for many who were sealed in. Yet the work is often monotonous and solitary. Many young guards turned to personal channels and vlogs, hoping the attention economy might lift low wages and grant visibility.

### [Nobody](https://eventstructure.com/Nobody) / 啥都不是

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: 3D transparent resin printing, printed car film, glasurit / 3D透明树脂打印，打印汽车膜，鹦鹉漆

**Size**: 45 x 53 x 83 cm

**中文描述**: 在一个AI 利用图片生成3D的平台上，有个公开案例：以一名亚洲男性为对象，艺术家将其3D模型用透明树脂打印，并用车模贴花工艺把头部贴图覆回实物。源图是否也是AI生成不得而知。这个随机的“亚洲男性”像标本般被测试后遗留在算力驱动的网站上——无名，却承载身份政治，如同一张孤独的身份证。

**Description**: On an image-to-3D AI platform, a public case features an “Asian male” whose model is printed in transparent resin, with the head texture reapplied by an automotive decal technique. Whether the source image was itself AI-generated is unknown. This random “Asian male”—a specimen of sorts—remains on a compute-heavy site after testing: nameless yet burdened with identity politics, like a solitary ID card.

### [One ritual](https://eventstructure.com/One-ritual) / 一个仪式

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Video

**Materials**: video / 视频

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 12‘00’‘

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/1113505913

**中文描述**: 以郭老师与药水哥的标志性片段为骨架，将“耶斯莫拉”“迷hotel”“您配吗”等梗语以动态字体化作屏幕的呼吸与鼓点，让语言在复读中自我增幅，召唤出一场持续生成的“直播仪式”。看与被看在弹幕与切片之间迭代，围观者在狂欢中获得短暂连结，却在笑声散场的静默里照见“乐子人”式的疏离与空心，孤独像回声一样从喧嚣深处返场。抽象文化可被概括为一种反逻辑、反叙事、反权威的网络亚文化，通过脏话、方言、错位语义与黑话化再生产，完成对主流话语的“消解”与“滑移”。其渊源可追溯至2015年前后的直播潮与“6324”等主播社群生态，并在围观、嘲讽、二创的循环中被持续放大。抽象内容以“反常识—反精致—反逻辑”的即时愉悦为吸力，满足“娱乐至上”的观看逻辑，观众通过复读与二创获得短暂的共同体错觉。然而，围观者多以“乐子人”心态消费“他者的出丑”，以恶搞与冷嘲构筑脆弱的连接，情感承诺极低，导致共时热闹与纵深孤独并存。抽象文化提供了可快速合唱的语言模板，却难以生成稳定的社群纽带，映照出社会原子化语境中“人—人关系”的空洞化。

**Description**: Built on iconic clips by Guo Laoshi and Yaoshui-ge, catchphrases like “yesmola,” “mi hotel,” and “Are you worthy?” become kinetic typography—breath and beat for the screen. Through repetition, language amplifies itself, conjuring a “livestream ritual” that keeps generating. Seeing and being seen iterate between barrages and clips; the crowd touches a fleeting bond in the carnival, only to meet, in the hush after laughter, the lezi-ren’s (fun-seeker’s) alienation and hollow core—loneliness returning like an echo from noise. “Abstract culture” names an online subculture that is anti-logic, anti-narrative, anti-authority, dissolving mainstream speech through profanity, dialect, semantic slippage, and insider jargon. Emerging from the livestream wave circa 2015 and streamer scenes like “6324,” it grows through watching, mockery, and remixes. Its pull is an instant gratification of “anti-common sense—anti-refinement—anti-logic,” feeding a watchword of entertainment-first; viewers gain a brief illusion of commonality by repetition and remix. Yet most look on as lezi-ren, consuming others’ embarrassment with spoof and cold sneer. The ties are thin, the affect low: synchronous bustle alongside deep solitude. Abstract culture offers a chorus-ready template, but struggles to form durable bonds, reflecting how “person-to-person” relations hollow out in an atomized society.

### [Squab](https://eventstructure.com/Squab) / 乳鸽

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Squab model, camera, metal acrylic structure / 乳鸽模型，摄像头，金属亚克力结构

**Size**: 20 x 37 x 41 cm

**中文描述**: 许多公共户外摄像头为防止鸽子停歇和排泄，会安装特制的金属防鸟刺。作品借用这一日常装置，并将一只乳鸽模型“扎”在刺上。乳鸽在华语文化中是一种常见且受欢迎的食材，常见于粤菜与港式料理，被视为高蛋白、低脂的理想选择；对移民而言，乳鸽与诸多原乡食物一样，承载维系语言与社群的纽带，唤起有关“家”的熟悉感，缓解孤独与疏离。然而，当“乳鸽”作为食物的现实，与“鸽子”在更广泛语境中象征和平与洁净的意象相遇时，关于文化身份的隔阂与偏见也随之浮现。

**Description**: To keep pigeons from perching and fouling, outdoor surveillance cameras are often fitted with metal anti-bird spikes. This work appropriates that familiar hardware, “impaling” a squab model on the prongs. In Sinitic cuisines, squab is a prized staple—especially in Cantonese and Hong Kong dishes—valued as high-protein and low-fat. For migrants, like many foods of home, it binds language and community, conjuring a sense of “home” that softens loneliness and estrangement. Yet when squab-as-food meets the wider emblem of the pigeon as purity and peace, the rifts and biases around cultural identity come into view.

### [Sunbathing? Not dead.](https://eventstructure.com/Sunbathing-Not-dead) / 晒太阳呢，没死

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: 3D resin printing, hand-painted / 3D树脂打印，手工绘制

**Size**: 75 x 70 x 92 cm

**中文描述**: 一张在互联网上流传的新闻照片迷因，画面中一位女孩躺在乡村商店街的台阶上，用A4纸盖住头，纸上写着：“晒太阳呢，没死，谢谢关心。”艺术家借助AI平台的算法，将照片中的人物转化为三维模型，并通过3D打印与手工上色重现这一场景。然而，算法并不能细腻地还原人物的具体形态，模型因而呈现出一种看似随机却仍可辨识的“孤独”形状。

**Description**: Based on a widely shared news photo: a girl lies on the steps of a village storefront, an A4 sheet over her face that reads, “Sunbathing, not dead, thanks for your concern.” The artist used an AI platform to convert the figure into a 3D model, then re-staged the scene via 3D printing and hand painting. The algorithm cannot recover precise physiognomy; the result is a form that feels arbitrary yet legible, a shape of “loneliness.”

### [Two rituals](https://eventstructure.com/Two-rituals) / 两个仪式

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Video

**Materials**: video / 视频

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 10‘42’‘

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/1108889225

**中文描述**: 这件作品由三部分素材拼合而成：使用孙三通的神调《哭烟魂》、Ag祖传自奶奶的地藏仪轨行为视频- Ksitigarbha，以及宫泽发布于朋友圈的生活片段，最终被重新剪辑成单一的视频。其叙事线索来自宫泽讲述的东北（哈尔滨）同辈从俱乐部文化到直播带货再到转入“出马仙”式的“心理咨询/安抚”角色的转变，并由Ag以地藏信仰与“废墟—中阴（bardo）”的城市感受为精神框架将三者串联。

**Description**: Three strands are braided into a single cut: Sun Santo’s sacred tune Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ritual performance of Ksitigarbha inherited from his grandmother; and everyday clips Gongze posted to his friend circle. The narrative takes its cue from Gongze’s account of peers in Harbin: drifting through club culture, turning to livestream commerce, then—amid economic shifts—entering the “chuma xian” spirit-medium system to “see/soothe,” a role akin to informal counseling. Ag threads these with a framework of Ksitigarbha devotion and an urban sensorium of “ruin—bardo.” The trajectory mirrors phases of the Simplified-Chinese internet and public discourse, charting the currents of “folk spirituality—platform economy—generational livelihood,” and placing the consolatory function of Crying Smoke-Soul in counterpoint to a social role likened to a “psychiatrist.” Ag’s method draws on a Jiangnan rite for Ksitigarbha—“inserting stick incense” into the earth—both a family lineage and a way to intervene on site. In 2016, Ag enacted it at the former “Qijia Village” in Putuo. Shanghai, in Ag’s grasp, is a “bardo/illusory city”: center and fold, underground and edge, gleam and height as a single continuum, where roles and scenes turn on the axis “ruin—bardo—vow-power.” The “temporary ruins” left by the Dinghai Bridge relocation anchor the shoot and interlock with an incense rite on Ksitigarbha’s birthday, proposing a bodily way of seeing that “finds soil’s seams in concrete.” In the post-pandemic city, driverless metros and the “ghost train” rhyme with a “headless, tailless film,” linking to a clear-eyed practice of “seeing better in the dark”—a chain of metaphors that gives the image its “bardo-in-ruins” cadence. The finished edit lays its sound bed with Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ruin-body performance steers the image; and friend-circle clips puncture the surface as reality’s burrs. Folk belief, urban experience, and platformed life are made concurrent, elaborating a viewing mode and narrative in which “vow-power moves through the bardo.”

### [ai ai ai](https://eventstructure.com/ai-ai-ai) / 爱爱爱

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Embroidered handkerchief, digital print / 刺绣手帕，数码打印，金属结构

**Size**: 35 x 35 cm

**中文描述**: 收集一张二次元形象与战争图像拼贴成看似无意义的迷因，印绣在丝质手帕上；手帕一方方系在一起，如同火灾中人们用家中布料结成的逃生绳。那些在互联网里流动的无意义迷因，又何尝不是无数人抵抗孤独、悄然求救的绳索。

**Description**: A collage of an anime-styled figure and war imagery—apparently “meaningless” as a meme—is printed and embroidered on silk handkerchiefs. Knotted square to square, they recall escape ropes improvised from household cloth during a fire. The internet’s “meaningless” memes can likewise be lifelines: cords against loneliness, quiet signals for help.

### [Agent](https://eventstructure.com/Agent)

**Year**: 2024

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Acrylic, flexible screen, Raspberry Pi player, microphone

**Size**: 42 x 42 x 42 cm

**Duration**: loop

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/942741037?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Agent" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named "Internet void" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction. This serves as a visual interpretation of the "Internet void." The installation "Agent," composed of two flexible screens, discusses the relationship between hallucinations created by AI algorithms in graphic generation and human imagination.

### [Fine-tuning](https://eventstructure.com/Fine-tuning) / 微调

**Year**: 2024

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Acrylic, custom screen, Raspberry Pi player, microphone

**Size**: 24.1 x 20.3 x 4.2 cm

**Duration**: loop

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/943626589?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Fine-tuning" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named "Internet void" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction. This serves as a visual interpretation of the "Internet void."

"Fine-tuning" deconstructs the definition of fine-tuning in the application of LLM by documenting the manual adjustment of the character's facial and body parameters (craftsmanship) during the character creation process.

### [Minority Algorithm](https://eventstructure.com/Minority-Algorithm) / 少数算法

**Year**: 2023-2024

**Type**: Video

**Materials**: Single channel video, color, sound

**Duration**: 17'16

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/912041733

**Description**: Minority Algorithm, a video work discussing the void of the internet, includes stories of decentralized Counterhistory compositions in social struggles formed by the smartphone peeping perspective based on short video apps, the astonishing fact that drone killing videos in war are rapidly spread and gamified through social media with the blessing of algorithms, and the fictional narratives formed by AI computing power shaping artificial landscapes and natural disasters, as well as the devastation brought to individual laborers by the fundamental step of AI training that cannot be bypassed—manual annotation, and the alienation of people's perception of the physical world after being shaped by computing power. While I see the omnipresent computing power and algorithms, I also notice that the human heart is everywhere, and the flow of empathy and curiosity tears through the neat, proud, and expensive authority, revealing void and smelling the streams.

### [Prompt Engineering](https://eventstructure.com/Prompt-Engineering) / 咒文工程

**Year**: 2023-2024

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Acrylic structure, ink screen, circuit board, microphone / 亚克力结构, 水墨屏, 电路板, 麦克风

**Size**: 22.2 x 33 x 3.8 cm

**Duration**: 1‘39’‘

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/863749362?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**中文描述**: 在《咒文工程》中，阿角用 AI 工具生成了一个二次元的卡通可爱少女形象，从角色到动画和旁白，全部采用 AI 工具完成。作品主角的生成采用 Toxxy Style LoRA 模型——一个被微调成专门生产跨性别者（俗称伪娘，男性在变性成为女性的一个过程状态）的大语言模型来完成，其中角色正在不断说出生成自身的“咒文”，作品赤裸地展现了一个包含着社会偏见、矛盾的 AI 生产循环。

**Description**: In Prompt Engineering, aaajiao employs AI as both medium and metaphor, engineering a generative loop where technological processes mirror societal constructs. Utilizing the Toxxy Style LoRA model—specifically finetune to generate images of gender-transitioning individuals during mid-transformation states—the artist creates a paradoxical “Anime-style girl” avatar whose synthetic speech recursively recites the algorithmic prompts that birth her existence. The work positions AI generation as modern alchemy, where “cuteness” becomes a technological spell encoding complex sociopolitical negotiations about gender, identity, and the ontological status of synthetic beings.

**Description**: Continued the material selection in the previous gumdrop, Siu~ also uses cellphone and UV printing. The coating is fragile. After kneading the material and spreading it again, the coating will crack and fall off. The image's content reflects the clouds mapped by LED through the front of the glass. All the light that the eye can receive at this moment is dissipated and shattered in the next instant, just as worthless as one's thought.

**Description**: This group of images was made with iPhone, presented on the window by way of film printing, with the help of natural light to show different shades of grey. These images became the result of using the iPhone to see and my attempt to describe the process of seeing. Those that would flashback and blur in memory constitute a large void in life, failure details.

**Size**: Dimension variable

**中文描述**: ddrk.me是一个叫作低端影视的网站，观察域名不难发现，“ddrk”并不是“低端影视”的拼音首字，尝试拼出来，发现是“低端人口”，在网站的关于页面，站长写道：“我们的目标是提供最便捷的，同时支持电脑和移动设备的超清画质在线观看影视剧体验。域名ddrk.me是站长自嘲，不是指访问本站的您，请勿对号入座。”我习惯性地查看了域名的whois信息并记录了下来，把这些信息打印在工业薄膜上，放进空间中，薄膜很容易产生静电，会黏在皮肤上，地上墙上，也会吸附灰尘。

**Description**: ddrk.me is a website called Low-End Film and TV. It is not difficult to figure that “ddrk” is not the pinyin initials of "Low-End Film and TV", but of "Low-End Population" (dī duān rén kǒu). On the About page of the website, the webmaster writes that “Our goal is to provide the most convenient online viewing experience for both computers and mobile devices with ultra-clear picture quality. The domain name ddrk.me is self-deprecating and does not refer to you as a visitor to the site, so please do not take it personally." I habitually checked the domain name's whois information, recorded it, later printed it on industrial films, and included them in the space. These films easily generate static electricity, stick to the skin, the floor and walls, and absorb dust.

**Materials**: ten screens / 十个屏幕

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 1'54"

**中文描述**: 作品是与许聪共同完成。

**Description**: This piece was done in collaboration with XuCong. The work bases on https://research.google.com/ava/explore.html. A.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration, consisting of ten screens placed across the almost 14-meter long wall facing out towards Ernst-Reuter-Platz, explores, utilizes and critiques Google’s AVA program. aaajiao takes the freely available, already processed datasets from AVA and manipulates the image. While maintaining the visual language of AVA, with its use of the purple bounding boxes, he eliminates the desired information. An overload of images is flashing increasingly more rapid before the viewer. Mundane movements take on an air of suspicion hidden from view. The work A.I. Goooooooooogle infiltration is installed on the ground floor of the former IBM building on Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here, in the 1960s, the first data processors were installed, clearly on view to all passersby in West-Berlin. Now we are the data, we provide the data, we analyze the data and are continuously more influenced by our own data. Logged in, cookies saved, and continuously tracked, our lives are lived more and more online. The potential influence our own data may have over us is looming before us.

### [GATE x SANKUANZ x aaajio DIY "HTTP404" SET](https://eventstructure.com/HTTP-404)

**Year**: 2019

**Type**: Installation

**Description**: - This set resembles the 404 collective performance by aaajiao in collaboration with Sankuanz and GATE that will happen on 20.09 at our store.

- It is composed of a blank white t shirt, a HTTP404 roller and two ink bootles that will allow you to create a HTTP404 garment by yourself. Only 30 sets were handmade worldwide and each one is numbered.

Wash Care: Machine Wash at or below 30°C, Do Not Bleach, Do Not Iron, Do Not Tumble Dry

"404 is the error message which appears on blocked websites in China. Translating the digital message back into analog form, 404 is aaajiao’s subtle commentary on censorship and the flow of information in our digital culture. The message is always the same, no matter the diversity of content it is covering from view. Entirely site-specific, this work takes a new form with each installation; multiplying the message 404 in a diversity of forms and contexts."

COLLABORATIVE PERFORMANCE - Visitors will be directly involved in 404 painting the fabric on the wall with a special roller.

The fabric will be then taken down and recycled into special t-shirts that will be part of something special and meaningful for a good cause. More info soon.

DO IT YOURSELF - You will also be able to purchase a special DIY set during the event, composed of a small Roller, a blank tee and some ink in order to create your own 404.

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: PVC sheet, Solar film / PVC 板、车膜

**Size**: Dimension variable

**中文描述**: 2018年1月6日，千高原艺术空间的1000+实验项目空间将启动新年的第一个计划，带来艺术家aaajiao的个人项目“暴食／Gluttony”。千高原的实验项目空间以新锐艺术家的实验性创作为主，不追求作品与主题的成熟度或完整性，而是以更加开放的姿态，探索创作与展示的可能性，并努力带来特殊的观展体验。aaajiao，是年轻艺术家徐文恺的化名，也是他虚构的网络分身。他于1984年出生于中国最古老城市之一的西安，现生活和工作在上海与柏林两地。aaajiao的创作结合了浓重的反乌托邦意识，以及对文人精神的反思。他的很多作品都致力于探索新的科技和媒体影响之下的文化与社会现象。作品涵盖了社交媒体写作，数据处理，以及网络和移动媒介下的新美学景观，将今天中国特殊的社交媒体文化和科技带入了国际艺术的讨论当中。aaajiao的创作跨越不同的媒介，且数量和形态都非常丰富。在2017年，他的作品主要有影像作品“档案糖纸”，“进度条”，“柱”，“糖纸”，“乱数假文”；装置作品“404”，“水侧.石油”，“膜化”；声音装置“集群行为”；Gif动画作品“头像”等十余件，都围绕着以网络及其视觉和文化现象为基础的，对社会学话题，或者视觉与图像形态的探索。而在2018年的伊始，“Gluttony / 暴食”作为新的1000+实验项目将在千高原艺术空间继续这一线索，探究“作为自我的观察者将如何与吞噬痛苦的暴食自我相处？”，此项目从属于 “Membranization / 膜化系列”——从使用机器，到与机器共谋，甚至被机器所挟持，人类的情绪在面对机器时发生着微妙的变化，记录这些变化已经无法使用那些腐烂发酵的社交媒体，一些材料的组合却能够清晰刻画些许情绪的轮廓，材料本身的轻质属性同样暗示着情绪的隐蔽性。aaajiao的创作作品频繁展出于全球的美术馆和艺术机构，例如：《1989年到今天：网络时代的艺术》，美国波士顿当代艺术中心 ICA Boston，2018；《非真实》，瑞士巴塞尔电子艺术之家（HeK），2017；《身体·媒体II》，上海当代艺术博物馆，2017；《上海种子》，2017；《带我走（我是你的）》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Jens Hoffmann策展），美国纽约犹太人美术馆，2016；《时间转向：当代亚洲的艺术与思辨》，美国堪萨斯斯班塞美术馆，2016；《波普之上》，上海余德耀美术馆，2016；《黑客空间》（由Hans Ulrich Obrist与Amira Gad策展），香港K11艺术基金会临时空间及上海chi K11美术馆，2016；《全方位：全控制和言论控制》，德国ZKM卡尔斯鲁厄艺术与媒体中心，2015；《齐物等观——2014国际新媒体艺术三年展》，北京中国国家美术馆，2014，等。

**Description**: On 06.01.2018, the 1000+ Experimental Project Space of A Thousand Plateaus Art Space will launch the first new-year plan with a solo project - “Gluttony” from the artist Aaajiao. Instead of pursuing the maturity and integrity, this Experimental Project Space focuses on the experimental composition of emerging artists with a more open attitude to explore the possibility of the creation and presentation and to strive for a unique exhibition experience. Aaajiao, is the pseudonym of the young artist Xu Wenkai and the avatar of his virtual network. He was born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities, Xi’an, but now lives and works in Shanghai and Berlin. The composition of Aajiao contains a strong dystopian awareness and a profound reflection on literati spirits and sophistications. Many of his works are devoted to the exploration of cultural and social phenomena around the influence of new technology and media. These works, ranging from the social media writing and the data processing to the new aesthetic landscape through the Internet and mobile media, bring the special Chinese social media culture and technology the international art discussions. The composition of Aaajiao also crosses different medias with its abundant number and forms. In 2017, he composed the video work of "archives, Candy Wrappers", “Progress Bar”, "Column", "Candy Wrappers", and "Lorem Ipsum"; the installation of "404 Installation", " Water Measure - Petroleum", and "Membranization"; the sound installation of "Collective Behavior"; as well as the Gif animation work of "Avatar” and more. Based on the online network and its visual and cultural phenomenon, these works are all attempt to explore the sociology and the visual and image morphology. In the beginning of 2018, "Gluttony " as a new 1000+ experimental project will continue this clue in thousand plateau art space, and explore “how self as an observer gets along with the self devouring the pain through the gluttony?”. This new solo project, belongs to the "Membranization” series -- from the use of machines, to the collusion of machines, and even to be held hostage by the machines, there are subtle changes of human emotions in terms of facing the machines. It is unable to use these rotten fermentations of social media to record those changes, however, the combination of some materials clearly depicts the emotional contours, and the light properties of the material itself also implies the disguised emotions. Aaajiao’s work has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world, upcoming and recent shows include “Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today”, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, Boston (2018); “unREAL”, Haus der elektronischen Künste, Basel (2017); “Shanghai Project Part II”, Shanghai (2017); “Temporal Turn: Art and Speculation in Contemporary Asia”, Spencer Museum of Art, Kansas (2016); “Take Me (I’m Yours)” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jens Hoffmann and Kelly Taxter), Jewish Museum, New York (2016); “Overpop”, Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2016); “Hack Space” (curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Amira Gad), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space, Hong Kong and chi K11 art museum, Shanghai (2016); “Globale: Global Control and Censorship”, ZKM | Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (2015); “Thingworld International Triennial of New Media Art”, The National Art Museum of China, Beijing (2014); and Transmediale, Berlin (2010). His solo exhibition includes: “Remnants of an Electronic Past”, Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art, Manchester (2016); OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal Xi’an, Xi’an (2016), among others.

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 15'32"

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/269875758

**中文描述**: 《观察者》（bot，）展示了一个深深交织于数字过去和当下的环境。在这片交汇处，本地与全球网络、社交媒体、园林结构、公园、以及最终出现的自然本身，都合并至一种数字化的超表象（hyper-representation）之中。作品从角色扮演动作游戏借鉴了大量的美学元素，反映出一个既熟悉又略显反乌托邦的世界。在这个数字空间中，物理与虚拟的界限变得模糊，引导观众思考机器学习时代下的记忆的本质。

**Description**: aaajiao displays an environment deeply intertwined with a digital past as well as its present counterpart. Reflecting on this intersection, local and global networks, social media, gardening structures, parks, and nature all become amalgamated into a digital hyper-representation. The work borrows aesthetics from existing role-playing action games, reflecting a world that is at once familiar yet slightly dystopian. In this digital space, the boundaries between the physical and the virtual blur, leading viewers to question the nature of memory in the age of machine learning.

**中文描述**: 身份的焦虑促使我们找到了新的角色 — 用户，以此身份为背景，利用图形学编程软件在桌面上绘制一座柱，每绘制一块就修改一次电脑系统时间，既可以前往未来，也可以回溯历史。虽然计算机的系统时间看似无限，但实际上却被开发者出于整体考虑做了限制 (OS X，1969–2038)，一种无限又有限的矛盾状态正是我们处于身体和媒体交融瞬间的现实心境。

**Description**: Anxieties over identity have prompted us to find a new role: the user. With this identity as background, we used a graphics processing software to draw a column; each time we finished a section we would modify the computer system time — it could head towards the future, and so it could trace back in history. But the computer’s sense of time that seems infinite has to do with a limitation we programmed based on an overall evaluation (1969- 2038, OS X), and this state of conflict between the finite and the infinite is precisely the psychological reality we experience the moment the body and media melt together.

### [I hate people but I love you](https://eventstructure.com/I-hate-people-but-I-love-you) / 我憎恨人但我爱你

**Year**: 2017

**Type**: Video

**Materials**: color, sound / 彩色，有声

**Duration**: 25'04

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/225883582

**中文描述**: 大画幅单频录像《我憎恨人但我爱你》以电脑桌面为画面背景，短片里两位赛博格（cyborg）——一位典型科幻影视造型的仿真机器人带有亚洲女子面貌，一个由无数重叠窗口构成的生物电脑不断变化着莫比乌斯带——进行着机械、呆板、反复的对话：“……我可以当你的朋友吗？你看我像真的吗？我希望是的……” “我憎恨人但我爱你……” 这套关于科技、社交和孤独的经典的科幻范式，不仅在今天社交媒体的生活中得以应证，也在用户和操作之间重新界定人际情感的疆域。

**Description**: I Hate People but I Love You, is a large format single channel video installation. Set in Mac OS, the video features two cyborgs, one of which is an anticipated Asian female android, the other in disguise of a floating Möbius strip composed of pop-up windows. Both immerse themselves in a reiterated deadpan conversation: “…May I be your friend? Do I look real to you? I hope so…” “I hate people but I love you.” The classic sci-fi paradigm of dystopian sentiments regarding social interaction and loneliness is not only proven in today's social media life, but also redefines the boundaries of interpersonal emotion between users and operations.

**Materials**: TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethanes)

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/157851613

**中文描述**: 印花部分，为了让印花和 _Limited Landscape Unlimited Wave_ 的算法效果吻合度更高，突出精髓，我们选择了工艺复杂的七块版分别裁片定位以及手工丝网印。透明部分，我们采用了有着良好弹性和耐磨性的TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethanes) 材质。TPU作为弹性体是介于橡胶和塑料之间的一种材料，这从它的刚性看出来，TPU的刚性可由弹性模量来度量。橡胶的弹性模量通常在1~10Mpa，TPU在10~1000Mpa，塑料（尼龙，ABS，PC，POM）在1000~10000Mpa。TPU 的硬度范围相当宽，从Shore A 60~Shore D 80并且在整个硬度范围内具有高弹性；TPU在很宽的温度范围内-40~120摄氏度，具有柔性，而不需要增塑剂； TPU对油类（矿物油，动植物油脂和润滑油）和许多溶剂有良好的抵抗能力；TPU 还有良好的耐天候性，极优的耐高能射线性能。众所周知的耐磨性，抗撕裂性，屈扰强度都是优良的；拉伸强度高，伸长率大，长期压缩永久变形率低等都是TPU的显著优点。

**Description**: 和aaajiao的第一次见面，还是上一个夏天。得到同艺术家合作的可能性，还是第一次。脑子里的第一个反应是：到底应该做一件像艺术品的衣服？还是一件像衣服的艺术品？想来想去，作品要有作品的风格，衣服应该有衣服的样子。那我们就做一件工作服该有的样子吧。-Ginger （Majorelle）综合比较了经典外衣的各种版型，我们决定从四口袋的Military M65夹克原型着手。通过一次又一次白胚布样，并让不同高矮胖瘦的男性女性朋友模特试穿、调整。出现了我们现在这款男女通吃的版型，只需要对应胸围尺寸，就可以放心穿着。

**Description**: aaajiao(Xu Wenkai) is a media artist and a media and internet activist, he created his new work by visualizing Chinese mainstream news portals wireframe from 1999 to 2016. This work is expressed as a digital landscape of banners that give physical form to the works abstract description. Ultimately this work expresses objection to the consumption of information occurring in todays ‘digital world’, a form of ‘cheap and useless’ consumption that does not create anything meaningful. aaajiao makes data structure into changing comparative digital forms or ‘banners’ to investigate whether people change through consuming and digesting information in this age where information data and daily life are binding ever more closely. The title of this work like a code name of an organization or operation, sounds like a code command, concealing its double intent. We welcome ’s first occupation of REFORMERart city public art space on Hunan Road.

**Year**: 2014

**Type**: Performance

**Materials**: jewelry / 首饰

**Size**: Dimension variable

**Duration**: 21.02.2014 – 15.03.2014

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/88977098

**中文描述**: 《屏幕一代》@9平米美术馆是《屏幕一代》系列作品在美学探索上的一次小结。与前两次的展览比较而言，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的相互关系阐述得更加情绪明确。在《屏幕一代》系列作品中，艺术家最初为观众提出了两个命题，一是应用程序生成数据，转换成屏幕上的图像和声音，通过不断的自我展示，带给人类感官与情感的体验。另外一个命题讨论早已被信息化的“我们”逐渐变成信息的节点，使用屏幕的同时也成为屏幕本身，从而与屏幕彼此构成生态系统的现状。本次作品避开了新媒体艺术中容易让人产生理解偏差的“拟人”和“拟物”的观点，将屏幕与人，即科技与人类相互关系的大命题巧妙地落在一件细微之物——首饰上。一贯冷静理性的视觉形象，结晶糖块的味觉体验，吮咬糖块和反复拨弄磁球的心理暗示，心理暗示造成的强迫性的精神反应与行为结果，通过首饰与人肌肤相亲这一个简单的联结，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的平等、共生和共同发展的社会关系举重若轻地地铺展开来。

**Description**: The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum can be seen as a summary of the aesthetic exploration made by the Screen Generation Series. Compared with the previous two presentations, The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum addresses the interactive relation between man and screen in a more direct and clearer way. In the Screen Generation Series, the artist raises two propositions. The first is to transform application-generated data into images and sounds on screen and to give people sensual and emotional experience through constant presentation. The other is that as a generation having long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. In other words, as digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself. Aaajiao’s work aptly evades concepts such as “personification” and “objectification” that would easily cause confusion and misunderstanding of new media art. In this piece, a complex issue as the interplay between man and screen, or say between man and technology, is skillfully encapsulated in something as subtle as a piece of jewelry. The wearing of these jewelry pieces epitomizes a connection between man and screen. By combining visual images (which are cool and rational as always), sense of taste (of the sugar crystals), psychological hint (given by the action of licking and fondling), and compulsion (on both physical and mental levels), Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum manages to cast light on equality, co-existence and co-development of the relation between screen and man in a humorous way.

### [Ornaments](https://eventstructure.com/ornaments) / 事物

**Year**: 2014

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: 3D-printed resin, sugar paste / 3D打印树脂，翻糖

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/93179665

**中文描述**: 2013年，媒体艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)开展了艺术项目《屏幕一代》，在北京、上海举办了多次展览。随着展览的一次次深入，aaajiao(徐文恺)将《屏幕一代》的呈现从装置拓展到表演，并从视觉转换到触觉。此次展出的首饰就是基于《屏幕一代》“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”六件视频装置的首饰概念延展。《屏幕一代》旨在探讨人与信息的关系。在aaajiao(徐文恺)看来，人类的存在已经高度信息化，与屏幕彼此构成生态系统，我们既是屏幕一代，也已经成为屏幕本身。展览中的六件作品“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”分别抽象出人类的某种性格和情绪，人类与屏幕在互相阅读中已经形成了一种平等的沟通关系。与作品同名的六件首饰由艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)与首饰设计师沈磊合作完成，六件首饰置于桌面，其本身又构成了一件独立的首饰装置。首饰的模型基本上来源于《屏幕一代》中的算法表演Meta。但艺术家摒弃了此前的视觉逻辑，而诉诸于单纯的触觉体验。譬如，“坚硬”的耳坠部分除了3D打印树脂之外特意包裹了部分翻糖晶体，人们可以通过吮食糖来塑造独一无二的形态；永磁体构造的指环“反复”迫使人强迫症般地旋转把玩；而“闹”则凭借浑身的利刺与人的掌心彼此搏斗角力，最终实现人与信息的平衡。

**Description**: In 2013, media artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) launched an art project titled The Screen Generation which was exhibited many times in Beijing and Shanghai. As exhibitions went on, aaajiao developed the scope of The Screen Generation from installations to performances and from vision to touch. The jewelry exhibited here are conceptual extension based on the 6 video installations, namely Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise, of that project. The Screen Generation aims to explore the relationship between man and information. In his view, aaajiao believes that the existence of mankind is highly informationized and has formed an ecological system together with the Screen. We are the Screen Generation and have become the screen itself. The 6 pieces titled Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise respectively represent certain human character and emotion. Through reading each other we have built an equal relationship of communication. The 6 pieces of jewelry with the same titles as the installations are results of collaboration between media artist aaajiao and jewelry designer Shen Lei. When the jewelry is placed on the table, they become an independent jewelry installation. The models of the jewelry come from Meta, an algorithm performance of The Screen Generation. But the artists abandoned previous visual logics; instead they resorted to pure touch experience. For example, in addition to 3D-printed resin, the eardrops titled Hard have sugar paste coating on part of the material. The sugar coating can be sucked on to create unique shapes; The ring titled Repeatedly is made of permanent magnet which compels one to play with it repeatedly as if he suffers from OCD; The Noise fights one’s palm with spikes to finally reach equality between man and information. The artists subverted the stereotype of jewelry which is “precious metal to decorate human body”. They not only have trendy looks, but also try to interact with human body and have dialogues at every unintentional touch.

### [Light is shadow](https://eventstructure.com/Light-Shadow) / 光既影

**Year**: 2013

**Type**: Application

**Materials**: MaxMara coat, blue color / MaxMara外套，蓝色

**中文描述**: Light is shadow / 光既影,的概念是来自我之后想做的个展项目 The Screen Generation 屏幕一代,其概念是围绕屏幕(信息传播极大化)带来新的结构下,我们如何面对新结构(技术/科技维度),作品也涉及到technoetic / 技术智力的概念 (技术/科技形成后其本身的结构),我希望区别与我之前理性逻辑的思维,从个人更加柔和的角度给这个结构一些反馈。

Light is shadow / 光既影,是对The Screen Generation 屏幕一代部分概念的一种深化,新的结构带来了新的价值观,有些或许与我们固有思维模式产生冲突,在Light is shadow / 光既影中,光变成了影,或者说我们无法定义什么是光什么是影,我们看到的,理解的,只是对比度(色彩明暗的对比),MaxMara 101801 coat被置入其中,她依旧经典优雅,但同样她也不自觉的侵蚀,最终沉浸在一片蓝色之中。

**Description**: The blue we choose actually is the default color for all kinds of screens and projectors. All this kind of electronic device will provide a blue color when it starts. If we look the screen as a new dimension and the blue color will be the identified symbol for this new space. It likes a door to the new world.

The MaxMara coat is classic and always be truly exist in our real world. Now in the screen, with the new descript logic, the MaxMara will also can be identified as a classic and fashion object. We think that this style will be timeless in both of the two dimensions of the world.

As MaxMara expressed the fashion as classic and significant imagine of the object, the blue in the screen also has the character of simple but classic and unique. We express the fashion style in the screen dimension through the MaxMara coat in blue.

The basic idea of my work is happen within this “blue” dimension. In this area, we use a new way to explain the original object. If we said that in our real word, the light is light and the shadow is shadow, both of these two things are separated and only can be described by themselves. But now in the new dimension, light can be described by the shadow which we can feel that the light and shadow are combine together in one concept, that is why we call it “light IS shadow”.

**Description**: The Robotic Landscape of aaajiao serves as media art’s contribution to our integration with nature. The work is a mechanical installation that operates on fractal algorithms. The organic or wave-like structure of the work can be seen as the physical extension of a virtual simulation and algorithms. The image created by the reflective surface of the robot as it assumes motion generates points of interaction with the audience, forming an ever changing and expanding space. aaajiao’s work acts directly on art and technology, and has persistently engaged various paradoxes within the development of science. －Li Zhenhua

**中文描述**: 作品是与许聪共同完成。Meta是对信息（data）在未来如何呈现的猜想,它并聚焦在视觉的部分，而是通过呈现视觉构成的过程来研究我们所面对的可视化问题，即可视化的数据和真相是否有关，还只是另一种视觉腐败（语言腐败; 1984，“decay of the language”/“decline of the language”）的过程。

**Description**: This piece was done in collaboration with Xu Cong. Meta is a conjecture on how data is presented in the future. It focuses on the visual part, but through the process of presenting visual composition to study the visualization problems we face, whether the visualized data is related to the truth or not. It's just another process for decay of the visual (1984 - George Orwell, "decay of the language" / "decline of the language").

**Duration**: 9'22''

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/56334166

**中文描述**: 表现主义思潮经历了一整个世纪的变迁，与上海美术馆一个世纪以来的变迁一样，经由时间的洗练，历久弥新。影像抓住‘时间’这一线索，试图用一种重新构建的手法，去展现这一变化，通过对上海美术馆外立面的立体投影，采取描边、勾线、扭曲变形、表面重建、波形震荡、轴向层级展开等蒙太奇手法，将展览作品的变迁，用影像的方式重新再现。碎片化的叙述结构和对时间轴非线性整理，使时间的概念得以重构。

**Description**: The expressionist movement has undergone a century of changes, just like the Shanghai Art Museum over the past century. Through the refinement of time, it remains ever new. The images capture the thread of 'time', attempting to showcase this change through a reconstructed method. By using three-dimensional projections on the facade of the Shanghai Art Museum, montage techniques such as outlining, distortion, surface reconstruction, waveform oscillation, and axial hierarchical expansion are employed to recreate the evolution of the exhibition works. The fragmented narrative structure and non-linear organization of the timeline allow for a reconstruction of the concept of time.

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: cement, acrylic, screen / 水泥，丙烯，屏幕

**Size**: 18.4 x 14.7 cm

**Description**: Again using computer algorithms to recreate natural processes, aaajiao created a series of clouds floating on LCD screens. The portability of the medium (liquid crystal display being the new scroll painting, as it were) is negated by either fastening the screens to suspended girders, or placing them on concrete plinths. These pieces simultaneously engage the massive construction projects going on across China (and with that, the wanton destruction of traditional neighborhoods) and the peaceful contemplation seen in traditional Chinese painting and writing. They also represent the exciting modes of cultural transmission in the contemporary world. At once, these pieces evoke Alfred Stieglitz’s Equivalents and sculptural Minimalism. Liam Gillick, in describing the work of Donald Judd, puts it nicely. “You are not supposed to fixate on the structures in isolation or to over rationalise them within the late modernist tendency towards reduction. The work functions best when it is allowed to hover between its connection to its given location and the rest of the relative experience we bring to the room.”

**Description**: First discovered in the Mediterranean in 1883, the Turritopsis Nutricula is a hydrozoan, whose Medusa (jellyfish) is effectively immortal. When threatened, the Medusa’s cells can age backwards from sexual maturity to those halcyon days of jellyfish childhood. From there, they age again, then regress again, ad infinitum. This happens through a process called transdifferentiation, in which one type of cell switches to another type. For this piece, aaajiao created an algorithmically generated swarm of these creatures. As the pixelated bloom floats by, one thinks about how the digital age confounds the linear march of time. The two poles of Turritopis‘s existence–youth and sexual maturity–find parallel in our division between the virtual world and the physical.

**Description**: Placebo is a new series by Xu Wenkai, which consists of BDSQ, HAL, Text Format and Poor Mining. Together shown with this series are works from a different series, titled Cybernetics, made by the artist in 2009 and 2010. These works form a small documents, aiming at systematic and thorough examining the way of thinking, art making, expressing and presenting of this young and active media artist, so as to manifest his capability.

In Cybernetics series, the artist tries to reconsider data, the object of information technology inquiry, and comes up with an interesting and witty presentation on data’s existence, form, and perceptibility with Cloud Data, Water Measure and Blog Archaeology. In the latest Placebo series, artist turns to the stream of data flow, which engenders new structures, as well as the visual inertia and placebo effect.

Therefore this exhibition seems to be made up of a biography and a prequel of this biography. Such structure facilitates our understanding of artist’s distinct trait: on one hand, unique artwork construction methods, and on the other hand, the artistic conversion of artist’s know-how and thoughts in certain fields.

**中文描述**: 在作品《云》中，12块冰冷的纯平显示器模拟出了一小片昏暗的天空。与此同时，这个矩阵却也在数字时空中为我们营造了一片无边无垠的三维天空。由艺术家（或者更准确的说，是由计算机程序语言）生成的“白云”在虚拟空际缓慢漂过……那我们究竟该怎么去感知一个虚拟物体的质地、色彩、维度，甚至是温度呢？显然，我们目前还必须依赖知识（对现代数字化技术的了解）来做出判断。但或许在不久的将来，人体将能够“模拟”出某种“第六感”，使我们更好的去感知“数字时空”。

**Description**: In his latest piece Cloud, 12 flat and cold screens simulate a small region of a dark sky, but in the other way this matrix is able to contain a boundless 3-dimension sky of a digital reality. Clouds generated by the artist’s computing language are seen flying over the screens… So how do we feel the textile dimension, the color, or even temperature…of a virtual object? Apparently, we very much rely on the knowledge understanding of the technology application, but maybe in the not far future, a sixth sense will finally be stimulated in human body to deal with the cyber reality.

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/487835050

**中文描述**: 记忆贩卖机（2009），是艺术家基于可预见的科技进步（纳米技术、生物科技）所提出的一项“发明”。装置的外形与基本功能类似于扭蛋机，这是一种简易自助式贩售系统，在遍布全市的便利店都可以找到。与普通扭蛋机不同，根据艺术家的设想，记忆贩卖机所售出的每一枚扭蛋看似中空，其实封装有无数个微小的纳米级机器人。随着用户吸入扭蛋内的空气，这些携带特殊信息的纳米机器人就进入脑部，附着繁殖，形成记忆区域,并且同样购买并服用“记忆扭蛋”的个体之间，可以通过记忆区域相互通讯。这实际上意味着：人们可以进入彼此的记忆，完全获取包括视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉……在内的感官经验，并在自己的机体上获得全部“真实”的体验（还原）。装置上的电子屏幕播放着说明性的动画，向观众介绍这项“发明”的原理和用途。

**Description**: Memory Vending Machines (2009) is an “invention” proposed by the artist based on the predicted scientific advancement (nano, biotech). The appearance and basic functions of this installation are similar to that of Capsule Vending Machine. This kind of easy-to-use self-service vending machines can be found in convenience shops across the entire city. Different from general Capsule Vending Machines, this Memory Vending Machine sells capsules, which, based on the conception by the artist, seem empty inside but have actually encapsulated numerous tiny nano-robots. Inhaled by the user of the air inside the capsule, these nano-robots carrying special data will enter and colonize the human brains, and propagate themselves to form memory zones. In addition, different individuals can communicate with each other, which actually means people can enter each other’s memories and fully read sensory information including vision, hearing, feeling, tasting, olfaction, etc., and acquire the whole “real” experience (revivification) on its own organic body. Descriptive animation is played on the electronic screen of the installation, elaborating the visitors on the principles and purposes of this “invention”.

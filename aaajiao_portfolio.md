### [Absurd Reality Check](https://eventstructure.com/Absurd-Reality-Check) / 荒诞现实检测

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Rotating LED screen, 10-inch LED screen, digitally printed sewing doll

**Size**: Variable dimensions

**中文描述**: 该视频装置由一件数码打印的缝制人偶与两块按特定尺寸定制的LED屏幕构成。缝制人偶的形象源于对“精神小伙”（精神小伙”是一个网络流行语，用来形容那些衣着打扮独特（如锅盖头、豆豆鞋、紧身衣裤）、行为风格夸张（如跳“社会摇”）的年轻男性，他们看起来活力充沛，但其形象被认为带有“土嗨”的风格。）进行AI“去面部特征化”后的图像，视频部分分别命名为《两个仪式》和《一个仪式》。

**Description**: This installation combines a digitally printed sewn doll with two custom LED screens. The doll’s image derives from an AI process that removes facial identifiers from the figure of the “jingshen xiaohuo” (a meme for flamboyant young men—pot-lid haircuts, beaded loafers, tight outfits; exaggerated moves like “shehui yao”—whose exuberance carries a “tu-hai,” or kitschy-provincial, charge). The videos are titled Two rituals and One ritual.

### [Guard, I…](https://eventstructure.com/Guard-I) / 保安，我...

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: silicone, fiberglass, artificial hair, clothing, seat

**Size**: 75 x 75 x 140 cm

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/1117816223?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Guard" is a installation artwork created using silicone, 3D printing, and fiberglass, depicting the figure of a security guard bearing the artist's own face. The inspiration for this piece comes from the unique role and circumstances of security guards in Chinese society during the COVID-19 lockdowns. During this period, security guards—typically individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, veterans, or increasingly unemployed college graduates—were suddenly granted temporary authority by local governments. Empowered overnight, these guards rapidly transformed from community caretakers into authoritarian enforcers, imposing harsh and sometimes brutal measures upon the very residents they once served, resulting in numerous tragedies.

The artist compares this months-long, severe lockdown to a "Stanford Prison Experiment" involving billions of people, using the artwork to explore the moral dilemmas and struggles of individuals under extreme authoritarian conditions. By placing his own face onto the security guard figure, the artist reflects upon his own potential complicity: if placed in an increasingly extreme environment, would he also be forced to don the guard's uniform, feign sleep, avoid confronting reality, or even become an executor of oppressive power?

Through "Guard," the artist seeks to provoke contemplation on the human predicament under authoritarian rule, while also critically examining his own position as someone who has left Shanghai, now lives in Berlin, and holds the privilege of narrating the pains and traumas of this era.

### [Guard, I…](https://eventstructure.com/Guard-I-Long-hair) / 保安，我...

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Silicone, resin 3D printing, artificial hair, clothing, seat

**Size**: 75 x 75 x 140 cm

**中文描述**: 以艺术家自身的面部与身体形态为蓝本，通过拍照结合 AI 算法生成粗模，再以传统工艺完成的一尊硅胶人偶。人偶身着常见的保安制服，坐在椅子上，仿佛在打盹。

在中国，保安曾经多由退伍军人或从乡村进城务工、年龄稍长的人担任。近几年，尤其是新冠疫情之后，保安也成了不少失业年轻人的选择，与保洁、保姆一起被戏称为“吉祥三宝”。简中互联网中还流行“年轻人当保安，少走四十年弯路”的迷因。瘟疫封城期间，居民大多被限制在居所与小区内，保安在行政口头授权下承担起“关键角色”，掌握出入与秩序管理等权限，成为小区层面“最小单位的法西斯”，也是很多被封居民的瘟疫创伤。与此同时，这份工作日常往往枯燥而孤独。许多年轻保安开始经营自媒体，拍 vlog 分享日常，希望借助全民注意力经济改善低收入处境并获得关注。

**Description**: Modeled on the artist’s own face and body, a rough form was generated via photography and AI, then finished by hand into a silicone figure. Dressed in a standard security uniform, the figure sits in a chair, as if drifting into a nap.

In China, security work was once largely taken by veterans and older rural migrants. Since the pandemic, it has also become a fallback for unemployed youth—jokingly grouped online with cleaners and nannies as the “Auspicious Three Treasures.” A meme on the Simplified-Chinese internet quips: “Young people becoming security guards, skipping forty years of detours.” During lockdowns, guards—under verbal administrative mandate—managed gates and order within residential compounds, becoming, at the scale of the neighborhood, “the smallest unit of fascism,” and a locus of trauma for many who were sealed in. Yet the work is often monotonous and solitary. Many young guards turned to personal channels and vlogs, hoping the attention economy might lift low wages and grant visibility.

### [Nobody](https://eventstructure.com/Nobody) / 啥都不是

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: 3D transparent resin printing, printed car film, glasurit

**Size**: 45 x 53 x 83 cm

**中文描述**: 在一个AI 利用图片生成3D的平台上，有个公开案例：以一名亚洲男性为对象，艺术家将其3D模型用透明树脂打印，并用车模贴花工艺把头部贴图覆回实物。源图是否也是AI生成不得而知。这个随机的“亚洲男性”像标本般被测试后遗留在算力驱动的网站上——无名，却承载身份政治，如同一张孤独的身份证。

**Description**: On an image-to-3D AI platform, a public case features an “Asian male” whose model is printed in transparent resin, with the head texture reapplied by an automotive decal technique. Whether the source image was itself AI-generated is unknown. This random “Asian male”—a specimen of sorts—remains on a compute-heavy site after testing: nameless yet burdened with identity politics, like a solitary ID card.

### [One ritual](https://eventstructure.com/One-ritual) / 一个仪式

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Video

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 12‘00’‘

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/1113505913

**中文描述**: 以郭老师与药水哥的标志性片段为骨架，将“耶斯莫拉”“迷hotel”“您配吗”等梗语以动态字体化作屏幕的呼吸与鼓点，让语言在复读中自我增幅，召唤出一场持续生成的“直播仪式”。看与被看在弹幕与切片之间迭代，围观者在狂欢中获得短暂连结，却在笑声散场的静默里照见“乐子人”式的疏离与空心，孤独像回声一样从喧嚣深处返场。

抽象文化可被概括为一种反逻辑、反叙事、反权威的网络亚文化，通过脏话、方言、错位语义与黑话化再生产，完成对主流话语的“消解”与“滑移”。其渊源可追溯至2015年前后的直播潮与“6324”等主播社群生态，并在围观、嘲讽、二创的循环中被持续放大。抽象内容以“反常识—反精致—反逻辑”的即时愉悦为吸力，满足“娱乐至上”的观看逻辑，观众通过复读与二创获得短暂的共同体错觉。然而，围观者多以“乐子人”心态消费“他者的出丑”，以恶搞与冷嘲构筑脆弱的连接，情感承诺极低，导致共时热闹与纵深孤独并存。抽象文化提供了可快速合唱的语言模板，却难以生成稳定的社群纽带，映照出社会原子化语境中“人—人关系”的空洞化。

**Description**: Built on iconic clips by Guo Laoshi and Yaoshui-ge, catchphrases like “yesmola,” “mi hotel,” and “Are you worthy?” become kinetic typography—breath and beat for the screen. Through repetition, language amplifies itself, conjuring a “livestream ritual” that keeps generating. Seeing and being seen iterate between barrages and clips; the crowd touches a fleeting bond in the carnival, only to meet, in the hush after laughter, the lezi-ren’s (fun-seeker’s) alienation and hollow core—loneliness returning like an echo from noise.

“Abstract culture” names an online subculture that is anti-logic, anti-narrative, anti-authority, dissolving mainstream speech through profanity, dialect, semantic slippage, and insider jargon. Emerging from the livestream wave circa 2015 and streamer scenes like “6324,” it grows through watching, mockery, and remixes. Its pull is an instant gratification of “anti-common sense—anti-refinement—anti-logic,” feeding a watchword of entertainment-first; viewers gain a brief illusion of commonality by repetition and remix. Yet most look on as lezi-ren, consuming others’ embarrassment with spoof and cold sneer. The ties are thin, the affect low: synchronous bustle alongside deep solitude. Abstract culture offers a chorus-ready template, but struggles to form durable bonds, reflecting how “person-to-person” relations hollow out in an atomized society.

### [Squab](https://eventstructure.com/Squab) / 乳鸽

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Squab model, camera, metal acrylic structure

**Size**: 20 x 37 x 41 cm

**中文描述**: 许多公共户外摄像头为防止鸽子停歇和排泄，会安装特制的金属防鸟刺。作品借用这一日常装置，并将一只乳鸽模型“扎”在刺上。乳鸽在华语文化中是一种常见且受欢迎的食材，常见于粤菜与港式料理，被视为高蛋白、低脂的理想选择；对移民而言，乳鸽与诸多原乡食物一样，承载维系语言与社群的纽带，唤起有关“家”的熟悉感，缓解孤独与疏离。然而，当“乳鸽”作为食物的现实，与“鸽子”在更广泛语境中象征和平与洁净的意象相遇时，关于文化身份的隔阂与偏见也随之浮现。

**Description**: To keep pigeons from perching and fouling, outdoor surveillance cameras are often fitted with metal anti-bird spikes. This work appropriates that familiar hardware, “impaling” a squab model on the prongs. In Sinitic cuisines, squab is a prized staple—especially in Cantonese and Hong Kong dishes—valued as high-protein and low-fat. For migrants, like many foods of home, it binds language and community, conjuring a sense of “home” that softens loneliness and estrangement. Yet when squab-as-food meets the wider emblem of the pigeon as purity and peace, the rifts and biases around cultural identity come into view.

### [Sunbathing? Not dead.](https://eventstructure.com/Sunbathing-Not-dead) / 晒太阳呢，没死

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: 3D resin printing, hand-painted

**Size**: 75 x 70 x 92 cm

**中文描述**: 一张在互联网上流传的新闻照片迷因，画面中一位女孩躺在乡村商店街的台阶上，用A4纸盖住头，纸上写着：“晒太阳呢，没死，谢谢关心。”艺术家借助AI平台的算法，将照片中的人物转化为三维模型，并通过3D打印与手工上色重现这一场景。然而，算法并不能细腻地还原人物的具体形态，模型因而呈现出一种看似随机却仍可辨识的“孤独”形状。

**Description**: Based on a widely shared news photo: a girl lies on the steps of a village storefront, an A4 sheet over her face that reads, “Sunbathing, not dead, thanks for your concern.” The artist used an AI platform to convert the figure into a 3D model, then re-staged the scene via 3D printing and hand painting. The algorithm cannot recover precise physiognomy; the result is a form that feels arbitrary yet legible, a shape of “loneliness.”

### [Two rituals](https://eventstructure.com/Two-rituals) / 两个仪式

**Year**: 2025

**Type**: Video

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 10‘42’‘

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/1108889225

**中文描述**: 这件作品由三部分素材拼合而成：使用孙三通的神调《哭烟魂》、Ag祖传自奶奶的地藏仪轨行为视频- Ksitigarbha，以及宫泽发布于朋友圈的生活片段，最终被重新剪辑成单一的视频。其叙事线索来自宫泽讲述的东北（哈尔滨）同辈从俱乐部文化到直播带货再到转入“出马仙”式的“心理咨询/安抚”角色的转变，并由Ag以地藏信仰与“废墟—中阴（bardo）”的城市感受为精神框架将三者串联。作品的叙事线索来自宫泽对东北（哈尔滨）同辈的一段代际轨迹的讲述：从少年混迹俱乐部、进入club工作，转向直播带货，再在经济转折后进入“出马仙”体系，以“看事/安抚”的方式承担某种“心理咨询”角色。这一路径与简中互联网及社会舆论的阶段性变迁同频，呈现“民间灵性—平台经济—代际生计”的流变，并在语义上将“心理医生式”的社会角色与《哭烟魂》的劝解功能对位。Ag的行动框架来自江南关于地藏的民间供养仪轨“插棒香（插地香）”——既是家族传承，也是其介入城市现场的方法论。2016年，Ag曾在普陀“七家村”旧址公开完成相关仪式。Ag对上海的整体感知是“中阴（bardo）/幻觉之城”：将中心的褶皱、地下与边缘与高耸光鲜视为同一连续体，并以“废墟—中阴—愿力”的转换逻辑来塑造角色与场景。定海桥动迁后的“暂时性废墟”成为拍摄起点，并与地藏诞辰日完成的插香仪轨相互嵌合，指向一种“在混凝土中寻找泥土缝隙”的身体化观看方式。后疫情时期的无人驾驶地铁与“幽灵列车”意象呼应“无头无尾的电影”，与“在黑暗中看得更清”的清眼动作构成隐喻链条，支撑“中阴在废墟中”的影像语感。最终成片以《哭烟魂》铺陈声场，Ag的废墟身体表演执掌视觉叙事，朋友圈的日常影像作为现实的刺点插入。此种并置让民间信仰、当代城市经验与平台化生活同时发生，构筑出“愿力穿行中阴”的观看机制与叙事框架。

**Description**: Three strands are braided into a single cut: Sun Santo’s sacred tune Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ritual performance of Ksitigarbha inherited from his grandmother; and everyday clips Gongze posted to his friend circle. The narrative takes its cue from Gongze’s account of peers in Harbin: drifting through club culture, turning to livestream commerce, then—amid economic shifts—entering the “chuma xian” spirit-medium system to “see/soothe,” a role akin to informal counseling. Ag threads these with a framework of Ksitigarbha devotion and an urban sensorium of “ruin—bardo.” The trajectory mirrors phases of the Simplified-Chinese internet and public discourse, charting the currents of “folk spirituality—platform economy—generational livelihood,” and placing the consolatory function of Crying Smoke-Soul in counterpoint to a social role likened to a “psychiatrist.” Ag’s method draws on a Jiangnan rite for Ksitigarbha—“inserting stick incense” into the earth—both a family lineage and a way to intervene on site. In 2016, Ag enacted it at the former “Qijia Village” in Putuo. Shanghai, in Ag’s grasp, is a “bardo/illusory city”: center and fold, underground and edge, gleam and height as a single continuum, where roles and scenes turn on the axis “ruin—bardo—vow-power.” The “temporary ruins” left by the Dinghai Bridge relocation anchor the shoot and interlock with an incense rite on Ksitigarbha’s birthday, proposing a bodily way of seeing that “finds soil’s seams in concrete.” In the post-pandemic city, driverless metros and the “ghost train” rhyme with a “headless, tailless film,” linking to a clear-eyed practice of “seeing better in the dark”—a chain of metaphors that gives the image its “bardo-in-ruins” cadence. The finished edit lays its sound bed with Crying Smoke-Soul; Ag’s ruin-body performance steers the image; and friend-circle clips puncture the surface as reality’s burrs. Folk belief, urban experience, and platformed life are made concurrent, elaborating a viewing mode and narrative in which “vow-power moves through the bardo.”

### [ai ai ai](https://eventstructure.com/ai-ai-ai) / 爱爱爱

**Year**: 2024-2025

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Embroidered handkerchief, digital print / 刺绣手帕，数码打印，金属结构

**Size**: 35 x 35 cm

**中文描述**: 收集一张二次元形象与战争图像拼贴成看似无意义的迷因，印绣在丝质手帕上；手帕一方方系在一起，如同火灾中人们用家中布料结成的逃生绳。那些在互联网里流动的无意义迷因，又何尝不是无数人抵抗孤独、悄然求救的绳索。

**Description**: A collage of an anime-styled figure and war imagery—apparently “meaningless” as a meme—is printed and embroidered on silk handkerchiefs. Knotted square to square, they recall escape ropes improvised from household cloth during a fire. The internet’s “meaningless” memes can likewise be lifelines: cords against loneliness, quiet signals for help.

### [Agent](https://eventstructure.com/Agent)

**Year**: 2024

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Acrylic, flexible screen, Raspberry Pi player, microphone

**Size**: 42 x 42 x 42 cm

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/942741037?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Agent" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named "Internet void" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations. The character draws inspiration from the fact that fungi are independent from plants, animals, and other eukaryotes, cannot perform photosynthesis, and, like plants, cannot move but can extend their habitat through the growth of mycelium and can spread over long distances through spores produced by sexual or asexual reproduction. This serves as a visual interpretation of the "Internet void." The installation "Agent," composed of two flexible screens, discusses the relationship between hallucinations created by AI algorithms in graphic generation and human imagination.

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/943626589?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**Description**: "Fine-tuning" borrows proprietary terms from the Large language model (LLM) document or the Cookie Book as their titles. Additionally, I have created a fictional character named "Internet void" in the livd2d format to serve as the protagonist of the video installations.

This serves as a visual interpretation of the "Internet void."

"Fine-tuning" deconstructs the definition of fine-tuning in the application of LLM by documenting the manual adjustment of the character's facial and body parameters (craftsmanship) during the character creation process.

### [Minority Algorithm](https://eventstructure.com/Minority-Algorithm) / 少数算法

**Year**: 2023-2024

**Type**: Video

**Materials**: Internet Void

**Duration**: 17'16"

**Video**: https://vimeo.com/912041733

**Description**: Minority Algorithm, a video work discussing the void of the internet, includes stories of decentralized Counterhistory compositions in social struggles formed by the smartphone peeping perspective based on short video apps, the astonishing fact that drone killing videos in war are rapidly spread and gamified through social media with the blessing of algorithms, and the fictional narratives formed by AI computing power shaping artificial landscapes and natural disasters, as well as the devastation brought to individual laborers by the fundamental step of AI training that cannot be bypassed—manual annotation, and the alienation of people's perception of the physical world after being shaped by computing power. While I see the omnipresent computing power and algorithms, I also notice that the human heart is everywhere, and the flow of empathy and curiosity tears through the neat, proud, and expensive authority, revealing void and smelling the streams.

### [Prompt Engineering](https://eventstructure.com/Prompt-Engineering) / 咒文工程

**Year**: 2023-2024

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: Acrylic structure, ink screen, circuit board, microphone / 亚克力结构, 水墨屏, 电路板, 麦克风

**Size**: Dimension variable / 尺寸可变

**Duration**: 1‘39’‘

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/863749362?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479

**中文描述**: 在《咒文工程》中，阿角用 AI 工具生成了一个二次元的卡通可爱少女形象，从角色到动画和旁白，全部采用 AI 工具完成。作品主角的生成采用 Toxxy Style LoRA 模型——一个被微调成专门生产跨性别者（俗称伪娘，男性在变性成为女性的一个过程状态）的大语言模型来完成，其中角色正在不断说出生成自身的“咒文”，作品赤裸地展现了一个包含着社会偏见、矛盾的 AI 生产循环。

**Description**: In Prompt Engineering, aaajiao employs AI as both medium and metaphor, engineering a generative loop where technological processes mirror societal constructs. Utilizing the Toxxy Style LoRA model—specifically finetune to generate images of gender-transitioning individuals during mid-transformation states—the artist creates a paradoxical “Anime-style girl” avatar whose synthetic speech recursively recites the algorithmic prompts that birth her existence. The work positions AI generation as modern alchemy, where “cuteness” becomes a technological spell encoding complex sociopolitical negotiations about gender, identity, and the ontological status of synthetic beings.

**Description**: This is a chart circulated on the internet that records the scoring of Uighur residents by a Chinese government agency. On the far right of the chart, there are three options: "放心 / comfortable," "一般 / average," and "不放心 / uneasy." These are three common adjectives in Simplified Chinese. However, in the context of the Chinese government's attempts to assimilate Uighur residents in China, these most common adjectives become extremely violent. As a member of a minority ethnicity living in Germany, I also feel the violence that language continually presents in institutionalized movements, reminding us through the confrontation of two languages of the invisibility of power violence and the immense fear it inflicts on individuals. Choosing two official system fonts used in China and Germany, namely FangSong GB2312 and DIN1451, respectively. Additionally, to verify the authenticity of documents circulating on the internet, found Japanese publications that conducted research using the same documents.

**Materials**: Thin film, protective film on UV

**Size**: Dimension variable

**中文描述**: ddrk.me是一个叫作低端影视的网站，观察域名不难发现，“ddrk”并不是“低端影视”的拼音首字，尝试拼出来，发现是“低端人口”，在网站的关于页面，站长写道：“我们的目标是提供最便捷的，同时支持电脑和移动设备的超清画质在线观看影视剧体验。域名ddrk.me是站长自嘲，不是指访问本站的您，请勿对号入座。”我习惯性地查看了域名的whois信息并记录了下来，把这些信息打印在工业薄膜上，放进空间中，薄膜很容易产生静电，会黏在皮肤上，地上墙上，也会吸附灰尘。

**Description**: ddrk.me is a website called Low-End Film and TV. It is not difficult to figure that “ddrk” is not the pinyin initials of "Low-End Film and TV", but of "Low-End Population" (dī duān rén kǒu). On the About page of the website, the webmaster writes that “Our goal is to provide the most convenient online viewing experience for both computers and mobile devices with ultra-clear picture quality. The domain name ddrk.me is self-deprecating and does not refer to you as a visitor to the site, so please do not take it personally." I habitually checked the domain name's whois information, recorded it, later printed it on industrial films, and included them in the space. These films easily generate static electricity, stick to the skin, the floor and walls, and absorb dust.

### [Gluttony](https://eventstructure.com/Gluttony) / 暴食

**Year**: 2018

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: PVC sheet, Solar film

**Size**: Dimension variable

**中文描述**: 2018年1月6日，千高原艺术空间的1000+实验项目空间将启动新年的第一个计划，带来艺术家aaajiao的个人项目“暴食／Gluttony”。千高原的实验项目空间以新锐艺术家的实验性创作为主，不追求作品与主题的成熟度或完整性，而是以更加开放的姿态，探索创作与展示的可能性，并努力带来特殊的观展体验。aaajiao，是年轻艺术家徐文恺的化名，也是他虚构的网络分身。他于1984年出生于中国最古老城市之一的西安，现生活和工作在上海与柏林两地。aaajiao的创作结合了浓重的反乌托邦意识，以及对文人精神的反思。他的很多作品都致力于探索新的科技和媒体影响之下的文化与社会现象。作品涵盖了社交媒体写作，数据处理，以及网络和移动媒介下的新美学景观，将今天中国特殊的社交媒体文化和科技带入了国际艺术的讨论当中。aaajiao的创作跨越不同的媒介，且数量和形态都非常丰富。在2017年，他的作品主要有影像作品“档案糖纸”，“进度条”，“柱”，“糖纸”，“乱数假文”；装置作品“404”，“水侧.石油”，“膜化”；声音装置“集群行为”；Gif动画作品“头像”等十余件，都围绕着以网络及其视觉和文化现象为基础的，对社会学话题，或者视觉与图像形态的探索。而在2018年的伊始，“Gluttony / 暴食”作为新的1000+实验项目将在千高原艺术空间继续这一线索，探究“作为自我的观察者将如何与吞噬痛苦的暴食自我相处？”，此项目从属于 “Membranization / 膜化系列”——从使用机器，到与机器共谋，甚至被机器所挟持，人类的情绪在面对机器时发生着微妙的变化，记录这些变化已经无法使用那些腐烂发酵的社交媒体，一些材料的组合却能够清晰刻画些许情绪的轮廓，材料本身的轻质属性同样暗示着情绪的隐蔽性。

**Description**: On 06.01.2018, the 1000+ Experimental Project Space of A Thousand Plateaus Art Space will launch the first new-year plan with a solo project - “Gluttony” from the artist Aaajiao. Instead of pursuing the maturity and integrity, this Experimental Project Space focuses on the experimental composition of emerging artists with a more open attitude to explore the possibility of the creation and presentation and to strive for a unique exhibition experience. Aaajiao, is the pseudonym of the young artist Xu Wenkai and the avatar of his virtual network. He was born in 1984 in one of China’s oldest cities, Xi’an, but now lives and works in Shanghai and Berlin. The composition of Aajiao contains a strong dystopian awareness and a profound reflection on literati spirits and sophistications. Many of his works are devoted to the exploration of cultural and social phenomena around the influence of new technology and media. These works, ranging from the social media writing and the data processing to the new aesthetic landscape through the Internet and mobile media, bring the special Chinese social media culture and technology the international art discussions. The composition of Aaajiao also crosses different medias with its abundant number and forms. In 2017, he composed the video work of "archives, Candy Wrappers", “Progress Bar”, "Column", "Candy Wrappers", and "Lorem Ipsum"; the installation of "404 Installation", "Water Measure - Petroleum", and "Membranization"; the sound installation of "Collective Behavior"; as well as the Gif animation work of "Avatar” and more. Based on the online network and its visual and cultural phenomenon, these works are all attempts to explore the sociology and the visual and image morphology. In the beginning of 2018, "Gluttony" as a new 1000+ experimental project will continue this clue in thousand plateau art space, and explore “how self as an observer gets along with the self devouring the pain through the gluttony?”. This new solo project, belongs to the "Membranization” series -- from the use of machines, to the collusion of machines, and even to be held hostage by the machines, there are subtle changes of human emotions in terms of facing the machines. It is unable to use these rotten fermentations of social media to record those changes, however, the combination of some materials clearly depicts the emotional contours, and the light properties of the material itself also implies the disguised emotions.

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/269875758

**中文描述**: 《观察者》（bot，）展示了一个深深交织于数字过去和当下的环境。在这片交汇处，本地与全球网络、社交媒体、园林结构、公园、以及最终出现的自然本身，都合并至一种数字化的超表象（hyper-representation）之中。作品从角色扮演动作游戏借鉴了大量的美学元素，反映出一个既熟悉又略显反乌托邦的世界。在这个数字空间中，物理与虚拟的界限变得模糊，引导观众思考机器学习时代下的记忆的本质。

**Description**: aaajiao displays an environment deeply intertwined with a digital past as well as its present counterpart. Reflecting on this intersection, local and global networks, social media, gardening structures, parks, and nature all become amalgamated into a digital hyper-representation. The work borrows aesthetics from existing role-playing action games, reflecting a world that is at once familiar yet slightly dystopian. In this digital space, the boundaries between the physical and the virtual blur, leading viewers to question the nature of memory in the age of machine learning.

**中文描述**: 身份的焦虑促使我们找到了新的角色 — 用户，以此身份为背景，利用图形学编程软件在桌面上绘制一座柱，每绘制一块就修改一次电脑系统时间，既可以前往未来，也可以回溯历史。虽然计算机的系统时间看似无限，但实际上却被开发者出于整体考虑做了限制 (OS X，1969–2038)，一种无限又有限的矛盾状态正是我们处于身体和媒体交融瞬间的现实心境。

**Description**: Anxieties over identity have prompted us to find a new role: the user. With this identity as background, we used a graphics processing software to draw a column; each time we finished a section we would modify the computer system time — it could head towards the future, and so it could trace back in history. But the computer’s sense of time that seems infinite has to do with a limitation we programmed based on an overall evaluation (1969- 2038, OS X), and this state of conflict between the finite and the infinite is precisely the psychological reality we experience the moment the body and media melt together.

**Materials**: Cyborg - Lolisa by naonao / 赛博格 - naonao的Lolisa

**Duration**: 25'04

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/225883582

**中文描述**: 大画幅单频录像《我憎恨人但我爱你》以电脑桌面为画面背景，短片里两位赛博格（cyborg）——一位典型科幻影视造型的仿真机器人带有亚洲女子面貌，一个由无数重叠窗口构成的生物电脑不断变化着莫比乌斯带——进行着机械、呆板、反复的对话：“……我可以当你的朋友吗？你看我像真的吗？我希望是的……” “我憎恨人但我爱你……” 这套关于科技、社交和孤独的经典的科幻范式，不仅在今天社交媒体的生活中得以应证，也在用户和操作之间重新界定人际情感的疆域。

**Description**: I Hate People but I Love You, is a large format single channel video installation. Set in Mac OS, the video features two cyborgs, one of which is an anticipated Asian female android, the other in disguise of a floating Möbius strip composed of pop-up windows. Both immerse themselves in a reiterated deadpan conversation: “…May I be your friend? Do I look real to you? I hope so…” “I hate people but I love you.” The classic sci-fi paradigm of dystopian sentiments regarding social interaction and loneliness is not only proven in today's social media life, but also redefines the boundaries of interpersonal emotion between users and operations.

**Type**: Performance

**Materials**: Opening Feb.21, 2014, 19:00, Friday

**Duration**: 21.02.2014 – 15.03.2014

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/88977098

**中文描述**: 《屏幕一代》@9平米美术馆是《屏幕一代》系列作品在美学探索上的一次小结。与前两次的展览比较而言，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的相互关系阐述得更加情绪明确。在《屏幕一代》系列作品中，艺术家最初为观众提出了两个命题，一是应用程序生成数据，转换成屏幕上的图像和声音，通过不断的自我展示，带给人类感官与情感的体验。另外一个命题讨论早已被信息化的“我们”逐渐变成信息的节点，使用屏幕的同时也成为屏幕本身，从而与屏幕彼此构成生态系统的现状。本次作品避开了新媒体艺术中容易让人产生理解偏差的“拟人”和“拟物”的观点，将屏幕与人，即科技与人类相互关系的大命题巧妙地落在一件细微之物——首饰上。一贯冷静理性的视觉形象，结晶糖块的味觉体验，吮咬糖块和反复拨弄磁球的心理暗示，心理暗示造成的强迫性的精神反应与行为结果，通过首饰与人肌肤相亲这一个简单的联结，《屏幕一代@9平米美术馆》将屏幕与人的平等、共生和共同发展的社会关系举重若轻地地铺展开来。

**Description**: The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum can be seen as a summary of the aesthetic exploration made by the Screen Generation Series. Compared with the previous two presentations, The Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum addresses the interactive relation between man and screen in a more direct and clearer way. In the Screen Generation Series, the artist raises two propositions. The first is to transform application-generated data into images and sounds on screen and to give people sensual and emotional experience through constant presentation. The other is that as a generation having long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. In other words, as digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself. Aaajiao’s work aptly evades concepts such as “personification” and “objectification” that would easily cause confusion and misunderstanding of new media art. In this piece, a complex issue as the interplay between man and screen, or say between man and technology, is skillfully encapsulated in something as subtle as a piece of jewelry. The wearing of these jewelry pieces epitomizes a connection between man and screen. By combining visual images (which are cool and rational as always), sense of taste (of the sugar crystals), psychological hint (given by the action of licking and fondling), and compulsion (on both physical and mental levels), Screen Generation @ 9m² -Museum manages to cast light on equality, co-existence and co-development of the relation between screen and man in a humorous way.

**中文描述**: 2013年，媒体艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)开展了艺术项目《屏幕一代》，在北京、上海举办了多次展览。随着展览的一次次深入，aaajiao(徐文恺)将《屏幕一代》的呈现从装置拓展到表演，并从视觉转换到触觉。此次展出的首饰就是基于《屏幕一代》“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”六件视频装置的首饰概念延展。《屏幕一代》旨在探讨人与信息的关系。在aaajiao(徐文恺)看来，人类的存在已经高度信息化，与屏幕彼此构成生态系统，我们既是屏幕一代，也已经成为屏幕本身。展览中的六件作品“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”分别抽象出人类的某种性格和情绪，人类与屏幕在互相阅读中已经形成了一种平等的沟通关系。与作品同名的六件首饰由艺术家aaajiao(徐文恺)与首饰设计师沈磊合作完成，六件首饰置于桌面，其本身又构成了一件独立的首饰装置。首饰的模型基本上来源于《屏幕一代》中的算法表演Meta。但艺术家摒弃了此前的视觉逻辑，而诉诸于单纯的触觉体验。譬如，“坚硬”的耳坠部分除了3D打印树脂之外特意包裹了部分翻糖晶体，人们可以通过吮食糖来塑造独一无二的形态；永磁体构造的指环“反复”迫使人强迫症般地旋转把玩；而“闹”则凭借浑身的利刺与人的掌心彼此搏斗角力，最终实现人与信息的平衡。在艺术家这里，首饰颠覆了“用于装饰人体的贵金属”这一刻板概念，它们并不仅仅看起来前卫新潮，而是试图参与身体，在你每一次无心的触摸中与你对话。

**Description**: In 2013, media artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) launched an art project titled The Screen Generation which was exhibited many times in Beijing and Shanghai. As exhibitions went on, aaajiao developed the scope of The Screen Generation from installations to performances and from vision to touch. The jewelry exhibited here are conceptual extension based on the 6 video installations, namely Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise, of that project. The Screen Generation aims to explore the relationship between man and information. In his view, aaajiao believes that the existence of mankind is highly informationized and has formed an ecological system together with the Screen. We are the Screen Generation and have become the screen itself. The 6 pieces titled Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static and Noise respectively represent certain human character and emotion. Through reading each other we have built an equal relationship of communication. The 6 pieces of jewelry with the same titles as the installations are results of collaboration between media artist aaajiao and jewelry designer Shen Lei. When the jewelry is placed on the table, they become an independent jewelry installation. The models of the jewelry come from Meta, an algorithm performance of The Screen Generation. But the artists abandoned previous visual logics; instead they resorted to pure touch experience. For example, in addition to 3D-printed resin, the eardrops titled Hard have sugar paste coating on part of the material. The sugar coating can be sucked on to create unique shapes; The ring titled Repeatedly is made of permanent magnet which compels one to play with it repeatedly as if he suffers from OCD; The Noise fights one’s palm with spikes to finally reach equality between man and information. The artists subverted the stereotype of jewelry which is “precious metal to decorate human body”. They not only have trendy looks, but also try to interact with human body and have dialogues at every unintentional touch.

### [Light is shadow](https://eventstructure.com/Light-Shadow) / 光既影

**Year**: 2013

**Type**: Application

**中文描述**: Light is shadow / 光既影,的概念是来自我之后想做的个展项目 The Screen Generation 屏幕一代,其概念是围绕屏幕(信息传播极大化)带来新的结构下,我们如何面对新结构(技术/科技维度),作品也涉及到technoetic / 技术智力的概念 (技术/科技形成后其本身的结构),我希望区别与我之前理性逻辑的思维,从个人更加柔和的角度给这个结构一些反馈。

Light is shadow / 光既影,是对The Screen Generation 屏幕一代部分概念的一种深化,新的结构带来了新的价值观,有些或许与我们固有思维模式产生冲突,在Light is shadow / 光既影中,光变成了影,或者说我们无法定义什么是光什么是影,我们看到的,理解的,只是对比度(色彩明暗的对比),MaxMara 101801 coat被置入其中,她依旧经典优雅,但同样她也不自觉的侵蚀,最终沉浸在一片蓝色之中。

**Description**: The blue we choose actually is the default color for all kinds of screens and projectors. All this kind of electronic device will provide a blue color when it starts. If we look the screen as a new dimension and the blue color will be the identified symbol for this new space. It likes a door to the new world.

The MaxMara coat is classic and always be truly exist in our real world. Now in the screen, with the new descript logic, the MaxMara will also can be identified as a classic and fashion object. We think that this style will be timeless in both of the two dimensions of the world.

As MaxMara expressed the fashion as classic and significant imagine of the object, the blue in the screen also has the character of simple but classic and unique. We express the fashion style in the screen dimension through the MaxMara coat in blue.

The basic idea of my work is happen within this “blue” dimension. In this area, we use a new way to explain the original object. If we said that in our real word, the light is light and the shadow is shadow, both of these two things are separated and only can be described by themselves. But now in the new dimension, light can be described by the shadow which we can feel that the light and shadow are combine together in one concept, that is why we call it “light IS shadow”.

**中文描述**: chi K11艺术空间荣幸地带来本年度的压轴展览，艺术家aaajiao（徐文恺）个展《屏幕一代》。作为K11 Art Foundation 大力扶持的中国前沿的媒体艺术家，aaajiao的作品专注于对数据的挖掘与实用，并试图以多种形式将其呈现，以此在数据与现实的“调制解调”之中完成对作品内涵的完整表达。他在电脑软件的艺术应用方面，扮演了国内外最新趋势的交流者与先行者角色。本次展览将呈现aaajiao的6件新作，区别于艺术家之前的两次关于对数据本身理性研究的个展，这一次的呈现将会是一次柔软的体验。展览将于2013年12月14日开幕，展至2014年2月15日，期间将会在chi K11艺术空间以及民生现代美术馆举办一系列公共教育活动与讨论会。《屏幕一代》讨论了早已被信息化的“我们”使用屏幕并成为屏幕本身，彼此构成生态系统的现状。艺术家认为，作为早已被信息化的一代，我们逐渐变成信息的节点。广义的屏幕是非平的、流动的、可移动的并已构成完整生态系统，它们无处不在，相互依靠，已然打破“用于显示图像及色彩的电器”的定义界限。而作为使用者的“我们”，则成为屏幕一代，亦即是屏幕本身。《屏幕一代》中的六件作品是“柔软”、“反复”、“坚硬”、“纯粹”、“静止”和“闹”，它们都存在和源自艺术家开发的电子应用程序。在作品中，屏幕也许会被理解成为这些应用程序的视听组件而存在的、相对来说随意的容器和框架，但另一方面，由于这些程序的结果存在于这些组件被观看者的接受多于它们所制造的图像和声音之中，屏幕因而在这些作品中扮演者重要角色，而基于此出发更深入地看，这些作品又是以人为中心。与aaajiao以往作品不同的是，这6件新作在体现出科技自我利用，在自身存在中呈现自己特点的时候，不再是从机器向外的，不管观看者在场与否的、单方向的操作，而是强调与人类感官和理解的互相作用。基于上述观点，这些作品并不存在于它们自身之中，而在一个人接收作品所传达的感觉信息和在他从中理解到一些东西之间的互动之中。这些“东西”并不只是一种对作品的深入认识，而是深入的认知本身。而在本系列作品中使用的显示媒介是平面屏幕，其意在于这些屏幕所显示的似是它们自身的不同方面，而在其他的作品中，它们则运用自身的表示功能，作出对于科技的文化理解而产生的相关评论。因此，当我们提出：“人与aaajiao的作品之间的关系是什么？”的时候，这些屏幕就会变成他的作品其中一个基本的元素。我们可以假设人在某一个程度上是由屏幕投射的信息所构成，它在半途中与人，与观众遭遇。人是屏幕的另一面，就像屏幕也是人的另一面。aaajiao 创造了一个在人和屏幕之间，彼此互相构成的生态系统。

**Description**: chi K11 Art Space is pleased to present The Screen Generation, solo exhibition of artist aaajiao (Xu Wenkai) and also the finale exhibition of 2013 at the space. As one of the young generation artists sponsored by K11 Art Foundation, aaajiao is a leading new media artist in China. His work features exploration and application of data in various forms, endeavoring to present a full picture of his practice and his thought behind it through the modulation/demodulation of data and reality. Known for his ingenious and innovative experiment in integrating computer software with art, in this upcoming solo exhibition, aaajiao will be presenting six of his latest works. Different from the artist’s previous solo exhibitions which showcased logical enquiries and research on data itself, The Screen Generation will share with the audience a more personal experience. The exhibition will open to public on December 14, 2013 and run through February 15, 2014. In the meantime, a series of public education events and seminars will be held during the exhibition at both chi K11 Art Space and Minsheng Art Museum. According to the artist, as a generation who have long been surrounded by information technology, “we” have gradually become information nodes. The screen in the broader sense is non-flat, mobile, movable, constituting a complete ecosystem. Screens are ubiquitous within our culture, allowing us to be interconnected as a whole. The previous definition of screen as “electrical appliance for the display of images and colors” has long been obsolete. As digital screen users, we have been developed into a screen generation where we become the screen itself. The six pieces that make up The Screen Generation are Soft, Repeatedly, Hard, Pure, Static, and Noise, which all exist and begin as digital applications developed by the artist. The screen might then be understood as a somewhat arbitrary container and frame for the visible and audible components of these applications. But by suggesting that the results of these applications exist less in the various images and sounds produced by them and more in the reception of these components by the audience, it can be said that the screens play an important role in the work of the pieces, and - taking this further - that these works are then human-oriented. Different from aaajiao’s previous works, the six new pieces all cast light on the self-display of technology – technology using itself to represent itself. The “self-display” in the works found here is not such a one-way operation – from machine, outwards, without regard to the presence or absence of a receiver. Here this operation exists as interactions with the human senses and understanding. Ultimately the works exist not in themselves, but in these interactions with a human that takes in the sensory information provided by the work and makes something of it. This “something” is not just an expanded understanding of the work, it is that expanded understanding. The display medium used in The Screen Generation is flat screen. In some of the works, these screens appear to display various aspects of themselves. In the other cases they work with the cultural understanding of technology and present certain commentaries on it through their own ability to represent. In asking “What is ‘human’ in relation to aaajiao’s works?” a fundamental aspect of his work is then seen to be these screens. It might be interesting to think that the human is in some way constituted by the information that the screen projects out, which then meets the human, the audience, half way. The human is the other to the screen, as the screen is to the human. aaajiao is the creator of an ecosystem between the human and the screen, one that constitutes each from the other.

**Description**: The Robotic Landscape of aaajiao serves as media art’s contribution to our integration with nature. The work is a mechanical installation that operates on fractal algorithms. The organic or wave-like structure of the work can be seen as the physical extension of a virtual simulation and algorithms. The image created by the reflective surface of the robot as it assumes motion generates points of interaction with the audience, forming an ever changing and expanding space. aaajiao’s work acts directly on art and technology, and has persistently engaged various paradoxes within the development of science. －Li Zhenhua

**中文描述**: Meta是对信息（data）在未来如何呈现的猜想,它并聚焦在视觉的部分，而是通过呈现视觉构成的过程来研究我们所面对的可视化问题，即可视化的数据和真相是否有关，还只是另一种视觉腐败（语言腐败; 1984，“decay of the language”/“decline of the language”）的过程。

**Description**: Meta is a conjecture on how data is presented in the future. It focuses on the visual part, but through the process of presenting visual composition to study the visualization problems we face, whether the visualized data is related to the truth or not. It's just another process for decay of the visual (1984 - George Orwell, "decay of the language" / "decline of the language").

**Size**: 12m × 38m

**Duration**: 9'22''

**Video**: https://player.vimeo.com/video/56334166

**中文描述**: 表现主义思潮经历了一整个世纪的变迁，与上海美术馆一个世纪以来的变迁一样，经由时间的洗练，历久弥新。影像抓住‘时间’这一线索，试图用一种重新构建的手法，去展现这一变化，通过对上海美术馆外立面的立体投影，采取描边、勾线、扭曲变形、表面重建、波形震荡、轴向层级展开等蒙太奇手法，将展览作品的变迁，用影像的方式重新再现。碎片化的叙述结构和对时间轴非线性整理，使时间的概念得以重构。

**Description**: The expressionist trend has undergone a century of changes, just like the transformations of the Shanghai Art Museum over the past century. Through the lens of time, the video attempts to showcase this evolution using a reconstructed approach. By employing montage techniques such as outlining, distortion, surface reconstruction, waveform oscillation, and axial hierarchy expansion, it re-presents the changes in exhibition works through imagery. The fragmented narrative structure and non-linear organization of the timeline allow for a reconstruction of the concept of time.

### [infinite](https://eventstructure.com/infinite)

**Year**: 2011

**Type**: Application

**Materials**: /

**Size**: Dimension variable

**Description**: Turritopsis Nutricula(infinite app) has to do with this mysterious natural phenomenon, which is beyond all co- gnition on human nature. The jellyfish reproduces itself asexually and its cells split continuously, from infancy to adulthood, and adulthood back to infancy. It is evidence of immortality found in nature. aaajiao transfers the jellyfish from the living into the digital form, as the examination and reflection on this phenomenon.

Turritopsis nutricula, the potentially immortal jellyfish, is a hydrozoan whose medusa, or jellyfish, form can revert to the polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. It is the only known case of a metazoan capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary stage.[2][3] It does this through the cell development process of transdifferentiation. Cell transdifferentiation is when the jellyfish "alters the differentiated state of the cell and transforms it into a new cell." In this process the medusa of the immortal jellyfish is transformed into the polyps of a new polyp colony. First, the umbrella reverts itself and then the tentacles and mesoglea get resorbed. The reverted medusa then attaches itself to the substrate by the end that had been at the opposite end of the umbrella and starts giving rise to new polyps to form the new colony. Theoretically, this process can go on infinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,[3][4] although in nature, most Turritopsis, like other medusae, are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the plankton stage, without reverting to the polyp form.[5] No single specimen has been observed for any extended period, so it is not currently possible to estimate the age of an individual, and so even if this species has the potential for immortality, there is no laboratory evidence of many generations surviving from any individual..(.

**Type**: Installation

**Materials**: cement, acrylic, screen

**Size**: 18.4 x 14.7 cm

**Description**: Again using computer algorithms to recreate natural processes, aaajiao created a series of clouds floating on LCD screens. The portability of the medium (liquid crystal display being the new scroll painting, as it were) is negated by either fastening the screens to suspended girders, or placing them on concrete plinths. These pieces simultaneously engage the massive construction projects going on across China (and with that, the wanton destruction of traditional neighborhoods) and the peaceful contemplation seen in traditional Chinese painting and writing. They also represent the exciting modes of cultural transmission in the contemporary world. At once, these pieces evoke Alfred Stieglitz’s Equivalents and sculptural Minimalism. Liam Gillick, in describing the work of Donald Judd, puts it nicely. “You are not supposed to fixate on the structures in isolation or to over rationalise them within the late modernist tendency towards reduction. The work functions best when it is allowed to hover between its connection to its given location and the rest of the relative experience we bring to the room.”

**Materials**: computer graphics

**Size**: variable

**Description**: First discovered in the Mediterranean in 1883, the Turritopsis Nutricula is a hydrozoan, whose Medusa (jellyfish) is effectively immortal. When threatened, the Medusa’s cells can age backwards from sexual maturity to those halcyon days of jellyfish childhood. From there, they age again, then regress again, ad infinitum. This happens through a process called transdifferentiation, in which one type of cell switches to another type. For this piece, aaajiao created an algorithmically generated swarm of these creatures. As the pixelated bloom floats by, one thinks about how the digital age confounds the linear march of time. The two poles of Turritopis‘s existence–youth and sexual maturity–find parallel in our division between the virtual world and the physical.

**Size**: 75 x 75 x 140 cm

**Description**: Placebo is a new series by Xu Wenkai, which consists of BDSQ, HAL, Text Format and Poor Mining. Together shown with this series are works from a different series, titled Cybernetics, made by the artist in 2009 and 2010. These works form a small documents, aiming at systematic and thorough examining the way of thinking, art making, expressing and presenting of this young and active media artist, so as to manifest his capability.

In Cybernetics series, the artist tries to reconsider data, the object of information technology inquiry, and comes up with an interesting and witty presentation on data’s existence, form, and perceptibility with Cloud Data, Water Measure and Blog Archaeology. In the latest Placebo series, artist turns to the stream of data flow, which engenders new structures, as well as the visual inertia and placebo effect.

Therefore this exhibition seems to be made up of a biography and a prequel of this biography. Such structure facilitates our understanding of artist’s distinct trait: on one hand, unique artwork construction methods, and on the other hand, the artistic conversion of artist’s know-how and thoughts in certain fields.

**中文描述**: 在作品《云》中，12块冰冷的纯平显示器模拟出了一小片昏暗的天空。与此同时，这个矩阵却也在数字时空中为我们营造了一片无边无垠的三维天空。由艺术家（或者更准确的说，是由计算机程序语言）生成的“白云”在虚拟空际缓慢漂过……那我们究竟该怎么去感知一个虚拟物体的质地、色彩、维度，甚至是温度呢？显然，我们目前还必须依赖知识（对现代数字化技术的了解）来做出判断。但或许在不久的将来，人体将能够“模拟”出某种“第六感”，使我们更好的去感知“数字时空”。

**Description**: In his latest piece Cloud, 12 flat and cold screens simulate a small region of a dark sky, but in the other way this matrix is able to contain a boundless 3-dimension sky of a digital reality. Clouds generated by the artist’s computing language are seen flying over the screens… So how do we feel the textile dimension, the color, or even temperature…of a virtual object? Apparently, we very much rely on the knowledge understanding of the technology application, but maybe in the not far future, a sixth sense will finally be stimulated in human body to deal with the cyber reality.

**中文描述**: 记忆贩卖机（2009），是艺术家基于可预见的科技进步（纳米技术、生物科技）所提出的一项“发明”。装置的外形与基本功能类似于扭蛋机，这是一种简易自助式贩售系统，在遍布全市的便利店都可以找到。与普通扭蛋机不同，根据艺术家的设想，记忆贩卖机所售出的每一枚扭蛋看似中空，其实封装有无数个微小的纳米级机器人。随着用户吸入扭蛋内的空气，这些携带特殊信息的纳米机器人就进入脑部，附着繁殖，形成记忆区域,并且同样购买并服用“记忆扭蛋”的个体之间，可以通过记忆区域相互通讯。这实际上意味着：人们可以进入彼此的记忆，完全获取包括视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉……在内的感官经验，并在自己的机体上获得全部“真实”的体验（还原）。装置上的电子屏幕播放着说明性的动画，向观众介绍这项“发明”的原理和用途。

**Description**: Memory Vending Machines (2009) is an “invention” proposed by the artist based on the predicted scientific advancement (nano, biotech). The appearance and basic functions of this installation are similar to that of Capsule Vending Machine. This kind of easy-to-use self-service vending machines can be found in convenience shops across the entire city. Different from general Capsule Vending Machines, this Memory Vending Machine sells capsules, which, based on the conception by the artist, seem empty inside but have actually encapsulated numerous tiny nano-robots. Inhaled by the user of the air inside the capsule, these nano-robots carrying special data will enter and colonize the human brains, and propagate themselves to form memory zones. In addition, different individuals can communicate with each other, which actually means people can enter each other’s memories and fully read sensory information including vision, hearing, feeling, tasting, olfaction, etc., and acquire the whole “real” experience (revivification) on its own organic body. Descriptive animation is played on the electronic screen of the installation, elaborating the visitors on the principles and purposes of this “invention”.

**中文描述**: 从0到1构成数码（code）世界，数字化生存早已经不是一个值得惊叹的话题，但是从0到1，再到0的过程中，也是佛教的从无到有和从有到无的过程。物质可以是不灭的能量，但是涅磐终将来临，无论是末法时代还是全球化景观，我们正在体验一个从0到1，再从1 到0的过程。

这个项目试图建立当代社会中的买卖关系，并将这一关系置入在一个无法预知的时间之中。同时这个时间是从基督教的开始为起点，以佛教的末法观为线索构成的网络作品。这来自我关心的两个问题，一个是时间的起源学说，来自神学、佛教及其它宗教对时间的界定方法。另一个问题来自历史与考古学的视角，纵观历史，在历史长河中，当代生活与生命的稍纵即逝。由这两个线索引发的这个线上作品将呈现一个微观时间世界的疾速变化，观念上我却希望在一万年的长度中消解那种稍纵即逝的感觉，如果按照佛教思想的平衡理论看：‘空既是色，色既是空’。也就不难理解为什么0等于10000。

**Description**: In einer Welt des Code, dessen Bausteine 0 und 1 sind, ist die Tatsache einer digitalen Existenz schon lange nichts mehr Überraschendes. Der endlose Kreislauf von 0 nach 1 und von 1 zurück nach 0 kann auch als der im Buddhismus beschriebene Prozess des Übergangs vom Materiellen ins Immaterielle bzw. vom Immateriellen ins Materielle interpretiert werden. Das Materielle mag eine unzerstörbare Energie sein, aber am Ende steht das unvermeidliche Eintreten ins Nirvana. Egal ob es die Ära des Verfalls der buddhistischen Lehre oder unsere globalisierte Welt ist – wir erleben es gerade, wie sich das 0 ins 1 und das 1 ins 0 verwandelt.

Dieses Projekt versucht, eine Beziehung zwischen Käufer und Verkäufer zu herzustellen, wie sie typisch ist für die heutige Gesellschaft, verlegt allerdings diese Beziehung in eine Zeit, die sich jeder Vorhersage entzieht. Dieses netzbasierte Projekt nimmt den Beginn des Christentums als Ausgangspunkt, während das buddhistische Konzept vom Verfall der Lehre der rote Faden ist, entlang dessen sich das Projekt entwickelt. Dabei beschäftige ich mit zwei Fragestellungen: Die erste geht von der Theorie des Ursprungs der Zeit aus, die sich aus der Definition dieses Begriffs durch die Theologie und Religionen wie dem Buddhismus ergibt. Die zweite Frage, die mich beschäftigt, bezieht sich auf Geschichte und Archäologie. Im langen Fluss der Geschichte stellt das gegenwärtige Leben, unsere Existenz, nichts als ein kurzes Aufflackern dar. Das Online-Projekt, das sich rund um diese beiden Fragestellungen entwickelt, zeigt die raschen Veränderungen in einer Welt der Mikrozeit. Konzeptuell hoffe ich jedoch, dieses Gefühl der Schnelllebigkeit über die Dauer von 10.000 Jahren vertreiben zu können, zumindest, wenn man von der buddhistischen Philosophie des Gleichgewichts ausgeht: „Leere ist Vielfalt, Vielfalt ist Leere.“ Dann ist es nicht schwer zu verstehen, warum 0 gleich 10.000 ist.

From 0 to 1 constitute the digital (code) world and its existence is no longer a topic to be astonished by. But the process from 0 to 1 then To 0, is also similar to the process from nothing to exist and from exist to nothing in Buddhism believes. Material can be immortal energy, but Nirvana Will come in the end, no matter in the Age of Dharma Decline or in the era of globalization. We are experiencing the process of from 0 to 1 and then from 1-0.

The project seeks to establish the buyer-seller relationship in the contemporary society, and place this relationship in an unpredictable time space. Nevertheless, this time space is set a starting point from the beginning of Christianity. By taking the Buddhist concept of The Age of Dharma Decline as a lead composes the artworks on Internet. This derives from two issues that I have been concerned with. One is the theory of the origin of time and the methods to define the notion of time from different religions, such as theology, Buddhism, etc. Another issue is the short-lived contemporary life in the context of history and archeology perspective. Following these two leads, the online works will present a micro-time of rapid changes in the world. From the conceptual level, I hope to absorb this fleeting feeling in a length of Ten thousand years. According to the Buddhist thinking and the balance theory: ‘Virtual is reality, reality is virtual’. It is not hard to understand why 0 equal to 10000.

This proposition not only has a scientific perception, but also has the Buddhist view of the world.

2. A 10,000 years contract between the seller and the buyer.

3. A virtual public space for the dissemination of the artworks.

Time phase exists in the virtual and the real world, and ultimately lost in the vastness of space. The notion of time is dispelled, without beginning and end. The project will countdown the time from its inauguration date, with a total length to 10,000

Years according to the Western calendar, eventually resulting in zero.

Party A hereby appoints Party B to rent the domain name and the space, and to implement this project. The responsibilities for both parties are:

1.1. Party A is responsible for the financial support to this project. The timeframe is from the project officially start until the end of 10000 years according to the Western calendar. Party A is also responsible for the future financial input, project adjustment (representation forms and technological upgrade, etc) caused by technical, economic and political interferences. Party A answers all the political or religion issues caused by this project.

1.2. Party B is responsible for the leasing of space, domain name and to provide the technical and maintenance support within the project timeframe of 10,000 years according to the Western calendar. Party B guarantees the public visibility of the project and the operational conditions under the condition of enough funds.

1.3. If either party can not continuo this contract by physiological reason, should point another person or organization to takeover the responsibilities of the project with a signed formal authorization document. Both parties keep the copies of the authorization document after the notarization. This process should refer to the first scene evidences (documentary films, pictures, documentations).  Both parties can not entrust a person of the corporation or organization unilaterally, which it might cause one party to cancel the contract and unable to complete the project in the anticipated results. The successors of both parties has the same responsibility to transfer this project to other person or organization. They can not leave the project unattended by self-running impasse caused by the economic or technical reasons, which it results the loss of the characteristic of the project in the transformations from people to people and invalidates the contract commitments, and see as the failure of the project.

2.1. Party A has the right to use the means of  sponsorship, sail, merge and other commercial ways to maintain the project needs of financial supports, but has no rights to end the contract unilaterally. The project should be managed as the initiators’ wish (Li Zhenhua, Xu Wenkai) till to the10,000 years cease in automation.

2.3. Both parties have the right to find the successors and sign contracts to ensure the project is well managed.

2.4. No party has rights to end of this project by any reasons.

2.5. This right is bounded with the contract and transfers to the successor(s) within the contact conditions outlined.

2.6. Both parties have the right to share the commercial benefits from this project equally by 50% for Party A and 50% for Party B.

3.1. Both parties share the benefit from the project equally (Exclude the normal operational or maintenance costs of the project).

3.2. The income source of the project may be from: sponsorship, sales, advertisement, domain name etc. Any forms of bringing incomes will be accepted to maintain the project development needs. The profits from the exece income should be shared equally between two parties (or the successors).

This contract will not affected by politics or any natural and man-made disasters (fire, flood, technique) running unconditionally until its automatically ended on 10,000 years.

This contract has two copies (The original copy should be preserved and a copy of the contract should be used to sign on the new successor). It should be fixed by new technique to preserve until the end of the project (10,000 years in the Western calendar), if there is any damage. Every signed contracts should be documented and preserved in the forms of  video recording, pictures and documents.

This contract will effect from (   day   month   year) signed, and validate to the year of 7991 (10,000 years in Western calendar). The contract will be invalid after the expire date and the project will end naturally.
